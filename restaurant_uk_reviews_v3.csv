Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","I got an amazing offer on a spa retreat and the place was incredible. The  process with buyagift was good but being completely honest,  it would have been better if I could have linked through buyagift to complete the booking rather than email the place separately to book.  Mainly because it wasn't immediately confirmed. Would definitely use again though absolutely! Thank you so much"

However we then booked afternoon tea at Harvey Nichols in London as we were going to the capital on another visit. We enjoyed this very much.

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!",The experience vouchers are easy to buy and a good choice of activities. I initially mistakenly purchased the wrong voucher - (my fault for not properly checking the available locations)But Buyagifts 30 day refund period made it easy to get that one refunded so I then bought a voucher with more accessable locations for the people I was buying for. Very good customer service.

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","I was given a voucher for afternoon tea and a spa experience for two, when I came to use the voucher this is not what I got. I couldn't find anything that matched this experience within the value of the voucher received. In the end I paid an extra £95 for just a spa day for two (£50 from the spa directly for a weekend charge 😣) Really disappointed that what was stated on the voucher was not redeemable. Appreciate the flexibility of vouchers on the website, but equally found the whole process of cashing in the vouchers and booking very convoluted. It was not easy to just book what it stated on the vouchers. Very stressful... Needed the spa after all that faff"

The therapist that I had clearly had a cold and sniffed all the way through- so not particularly pleasant. The facilities themselves were pleasant enough.  Think I would rather pay more and go elsewhere next time"

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","I felt somewhat misled as I bought a gift for a family member (an experience) which said had to be booked before January 24th. I took this to mean the voucher would expire on that date, however it meant the actual experience had to be before that date otherwise extra charges were incurred. This was made even worse when the experience I had selected had no available dates in this period, but in May! This meant the family member I gave the voucher to, had to pay to use their gift as they had to extend the voucher till later this year when the experience which made me feel bad. Other than this the user experience was average."

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!",Purchased a voucher for a family member for Christmas. The restaurant the voucher is for has now permanently closed. Buy a gift will not give me a cash refund. I have told customer service a voucher I will exchange it for which they said they would arrange but they are now ignoring all email correspondence and I can't find a phone number to contact them on. Feel like I have been scammed. If you have problems with your voucher you will find it very hard to try and resolve.

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","When I attempted to redeem my segway voucher, I got 'voucher unrecognised' from the segway site. Tried to contact segway but the office was closed despite it being within the opening hours. I then contacted buyagift. I was first told the experience was no longer being offered, then that it was, then to try in an incognito tab, then that my voucher was valid, then that there was no availability. I was offered a credit to buy something else and was told I was outside the refund window. When I said I didn't want a different experience and did not wish to be forced to take an alternative I was told a refund had been requested. Given the level of support received I feel this was the best option although it was very disappointing but I couldn't risk losing that amount of money. I personally feel the problem with the voucher code could and should have been resolved which would have been a positive outcome for both myself and buyagift. I did not feel the advisor really tried to get to the bottom of the problem. Online chat only is a very poor contact option. The responses from buyagift to the trustpilot reviews also mean absolutely nothing."

The extra money was paid and when the bank transaction was completed it showed a figure of £36.01. I contacted the chat facility on the website, waited 15 minutes for an assistant to help me then when I asked for an explanation about the difference in price, was told that the voucher is now valid and I have only paid £24.01. I tried to explain that the end of the bank transaction stated the amount was £36.01 paid and there seems to be a misunderstanding between what I was trying to ascertain, the increase of £12, and what it was for and the assistant, being unable to explain. 1.5 hrs later, yes, 1.5 rs later, and after I attached evidence of the increase message on my computer, and that I wish for the matter to be escalated, I was then told that I paid less because there is usually an 'uplift' cost  - whatever that was and is..asked what that was, nothing ..Long story short, my complaint has been escalated and I should hear back from someone in the next 72 yrs..We'll see but I will say that something isn't working right with the chat facility and the training of the staff who have to deal with the queries..What I don't understand is, why couldn't the assistant or his line manager explain the additional £12.00 that I eventually ended up paying for an experience that only asked for an additional £24.00?"

We typed in the code and pin details only to be left extremely annoyed and in shock… the hotel we had spent ages picking out was now not available in the list!! To make matters worse the list of around 200+ hotels has now shrunk to 6!!! 6 awful hotels in areas no where near us… and more importantly the one we had wanted to book at wasn’t on this list.Having read other reviews I now see this is usual for this company and has happened to other people! They have no phone or email contact and you have to go on the online chat and wait ages for a reply! I have asked for a refund for my upgrade amount but who knows if we will ever receive this!Don’t bother using this company it’s total stress and a waste of money!"

I would advise never to use thias company for anyone as it has been an absolute waste of time. If you want to cause a couple to argue and fall out buy them this as a present as its been very testing in trying to sort this out, probably the worst website and organisation we have every dealt with. My partner would suggest ""if you actually like the person you are buying this gift for, put some money in a card, instead of using this company, it been the absolute worst.If she gets one for Christmas next year she is going to burn it!!!

Was given a voucher for 2night hotel break last March but found the choice so limited I struggled to use it - nearly all of the hotels required an additional charge. My new year resolution was to try and use the voucher and so looked at swooping for dinner and one night stay. Found hotel on the BuyaGift site under this category, checked direct with them they had availability for night in February, went back to BuyaGift and swopped voucher to this. However once done, that hotel dropped out of the selection available-despite trying various dates throughout the year. It feels like one big con and I have wasted so many hours on this. Why doesn’t customer service acknowledge emails or respond? My experience to date is so bad I am considering options. What a waste of money. Please could customer service respond?Update  a few days later - still no response from customer services by email. My husband spent over 2hours on the website this morning trying to use the chat feature. Not helpful. Still can't book the hotel we wanted so thought we would try another one - impossible.

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","AVOID!!! Bought a few various Christmas presents for family members this year and thought they would be a nice change from a Lynx or Dove gift set. I now wish we had just got the gift sets!!Redeeming the vouchers and trying to actually book the events, hotels etc is a complete and utter nightmare. Finally managed to book one of the gifts after hours and hours of trying. It was a hotel stay which we had to put an extra £23 to (not advertised anywhere that this would be the case) so cost £123 in total. Only afterwards it was finally booked did we go on the website of the actual hotel and the same room, same date, same everything was £89 if you booked it direct with them.Contacted customer services while all this saga was going on, which is online chat only as they don't have a telephone customer service line that you can actually speak to a person at all and in this 1 hour chat, spelling of words like 'allow' and 'generate' were actually spelled 'alow' and 'genirate' apparently?! I clearly need to update my dictionary to the new version that these agents are using?DO NOT waste your time and money on this company as you will only live to regret it - as we have!Now cue the generic 'Thank you for your feedback, please speak to our online chat agents' reply below which is about as much use as the vouchers themselves............."

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","Don’t even deserve 1 star! DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO BUY A GIFT!!! My voucher expired, I just missed the 12 month deadline, but was ‘allowed’ to exchange my voucher for an additional £20 fee. Why? I do not know. I then chose my gifts - a subscription to OK Beauty Box and a Hello Fresh deal comprising of 4 meals for 3 days for 4 people (or something similar). I was then sent another code for each. I was unable to add more than one code to the website at a time and after persevering for an hour, had to use the live chat for help. They then added the codes for me which then generated an email with yet another code which I had to add to the individual websites. Ridiculously complicated system. The Beauty Box one worked but the Hello Fresh one said it was 40% off, not the free offer as detailed on the BuyaGift website and on the email with the generated code. Live chat had then closed for the day. I sent an email to customer services explaining what had happened. No initial response. No response after one month. Very poor customer service! I’ve now ‘lost’ the ‘money’ on my voucher as it says it has been redeemed, but it hasn’t. I also wasted a whole afternoon trying to sort this out and was very frustrated trying to use their website which is not at all user friendly when redeeming codes. I feel bad for the people who put together their money to treat me when leaving my employment by getting me a BuyaGift voucher. Their hard earned money has been wasted. If you want to treat someone, either gift them the cash or bank transfer them the amount - least then you know they will receive their money and will actually be able to treat themselves rather than handing over your money to BuyaGift. Awful company! I feel scammed! I have no idea how they have 72% 5 star reviews - maybe they pay for reviews?"

Find the perfect gift for every taste and budget here!","Terrible experience all round from buyagift: was gifted a night in a country retreat for two with a two course meal included - sounds lovely. However, when trying to redeem the voucher the closest hotel available to this was a Holiday Inn Express in Derby, added to this is the pleasure of having to pay more money to be able to book this hotel. Decided to move the balance to several delivered food services instead, took a long time trying to redeem anything and have received out of date cheese from one company, not very nice brownies from another and a HelloFresh voucher with a code that refuses to work - someone else mentioned in a review that they had been given an invalid code for HelloFresh too. T&Cs don't explain whether you'll have to pay further postage once these food boxes have been bought - I did have to pay extra which should have been clear when selecting the voucher. Tried to contact them via their 'chat' to be given the option of speaking to a chat bot only which gives stock FAQ answers - totally useless. Also only available during most peoples working hours, the chat wasn't even live until around 8.40am and I couldn't access a live agent. Have submitted a complaint via Resolver regarding the HelloFresh voucher not working, not holding out much hope that it will be responded to.Overall the website is awful to use, sending you round in circles, lots of experiences either aren't available or need further payment and it's very poor value for money. I'll never use buyagift again, and will be warning off others too.Please don't post your standard generic corporate response to this saying 'please contact our live chat etc' regarding this review, disingenious platitudes are useless."

My order (from December 14th) was not received. Still waiting after 3 weeks. Royal Mail Tracking say 'they are expecting it but not received it'. It's been showing that since December 15th. I have sent emails. I spoke on the live chat to Erin this morning. Apparantly due to data protection she is unable to access customer accounts. I asked if she could check if my emails were received. She couldn't. Calling customer service could incur costs but I am not willing to do that. I asked if they could call me. No they can't do that. It was dead end responses. I have no idea why they have a live chat at all? I see good reviews here but I have to be honest. This is hard work trying to resolve this. And it shouldn't.

That’s really the last straw.I am writing this review now as it is hours since my wife contacted ‘customer services’ and was told “yes indeed madam we do have quality control procedures - I will send a note to ‘customer services’ [another one?!] and they will be in touch soon and will send you a returns label”.The service is just shabby, as was the second jumper.Update as at 4 January.We rang again as no one had been in touch.

I thought great I will get myself some new clothes using these vouchers but things have not gone smoothly. First if you want to use more than one voucher the system cannot cope. If I used each voucher separately it would have meant nearly £5 postage on each order. So I phoned through to place my order. You would have thought their system would allow them to pick up your basket and complete your order but no, it all had to be input again. This meant that one of the items that I wanted was now out of stock, so I chose another colour, placed my order and was told that I would receive an email with my delivery confirmation. When I came off the phone it dawned on me that because that item was in my basket that was probably why it was out of stock, so I deleted everything except that one item and hey presto it was in stock. I decided that as I really wanted this item I would place a separate order online. The next day I hadn’t received the confirmation of my order so called to check that everything was ok. I was told it was but CS had to do something to complete my order. The following day I phoned again and was told the same thing, and that it was because they needed to check my vouchers. Today day 3 I still haven’t had a confirmation but I have received the order that I placed after the original order. I obviously won’t get anything now till at least Monday and there’s a very strong possibility that I won’t get the order in time for when I need it, before Wednesday. I don’t know what to do now because if it doesn’t arrive before Wednesday I don’t want it but in addition after this total fiasco I now feel that I don’t want to have an order at all. I am so disappointed ☹️ I have said about the urgency but no one takes any notice. The vouchers totalled £190 which I understand they don’t want to lose that amount if the vouchers were fraudulent but they are not and with the lack of customer service and inconvenience caused they are going to lose more than that from my lost custom."

1,The House of Bruar,"['Clothing Shop', 'Homewares Shop', 'Restaurant']",4.5,2023-12-26,L S W,I’ve thought long and hard about this…,"Scottish country clothing specialists the House of Bruar enjoy a unique reputation for quality that extends throughout our clothing, produce and art collections.","I’ve thought long and hard about this feedback. Having spent over £1000 online, over four orders in the weeks pre Christmas, I think I am now qualified to compare and contrast.No 1. I only realised that returns are not free when I attached the label provided under separate cover the following day and it was rejected at the Post Office.No 2. I subsequently had to pay £9.95 tracked to return just one item from the order. The full order cost me £4.95 to deliver initially, despite being well over the threshold at which similar companies would deliver for free. i.e. orders over £100. I reference John Lewis ( orders over £50 ), LK Bennett ( orders over £300), Hobbs ( orders over £150 ) etc. As 3 items from HOfB can  ( and did ) easily cost over £300 I ask again, WHY?No. 3. House of Bruar received my return the following day. Silence.When I emailed to request an update on the status of my return, they told me it took 14 days for a refund. Having returned a parcel to both LK Bennett and John Lewis on the same day, I not only received a notification of receipt from them but got my refund a week sooner. Why does it take House Of Bruar twice as long? Without the tracking, I would have had no idea if they had received it or not.No. 4. SIZING.It’s a mess. I purchased three skirts over several orders. A long kilt in size 18, a wrap skirt in size 18 an A line skirt in size 20. ( I should say that I’m a consistent size 16 across all of the above mentioned stores. A pair of trouser size 16 purchased previously from HOfB were too small but I gave them to a friend.)The kilt was tight and did up on the last belt hole. The wrap around skirt was enormous on waist and hips, ( even after Xmas festivities I could have jumped in and out of it) and I struggled to do up the size 20 A line skirt zip. The waist was very tight.When I pointed out in an email to customer services this lucky dip/random approach to sizing, I was told all the sizes/ measurements were available under each item description. But I’m confused. Are they trying to tell me a size 20 measurements are smaller than a size 16/18? What’s the point in giving a garment a size in that case? No 5. How is a customer supposed to buy with confidence if there is this random sizing? It means IN EVERY INSTANCE you WILL have to pay just to try on, if you purchase from this company online. To deliver and subsequently send back. Make sure you pay for tracking or the rollercoaster ride that is buying from this company will only just have begun.I made all these points to customer services in three emails. They chose to ignore and cherry pick which queries they answered. And it goes without saying, when I asked to be refunded for my return costs, I was ignored. I was told they’d pass on my comments and I’ve waited to be contacted before leaving this feedback. I haven’t been. I feel like they prevaricate and make the customer jump through hoops UNTIL THEY WEAR THEM DOWN. How is this service?I would say buyer beware. I won’t be buying from them again. I was also unable to use both e vouchers I’d received as Christmas gifts on the ONE order and had to buy the two items separately and …YES YOU’VE GUESSED IT….. pay the outmoded delivery of £4.95 TWICE. Each item cost around £150! Again, well over other companies free delivery threshold.I thought at least I’d get that money back, when I questioned why but Customer services ignored this issue and had the cheek to end their email with “if you have any further queries, please don’t hesitate to contact us.”But i have run out of patience and energy trying to deal with all this. Easier never to shop with them again. I HOPE IF YOU DO, YOU ARE NOW BETTER INFORMED HAVING READ THIS REVIEW. I’M NOT ALONE IN MY COMMENTS. SEE OTHER ONE STAR REVIEWS. SAME ISSUES. GOOD LUCK."

They are a large company with chefs all around the country and beyond. There's a great range of menu to suit lots of budgets; customer service is excellent throughout - questions are answered quickly and the whole booking process and choosing dishes is very straightforward. A small deposit secures your booking. There was lots of communication nearer to our dinner. The chef was great - had done all his preparation and only needed to arrive an hour before our start time. The food was superb, beautifully presented and delicious. He made small changes to one or two dishes to allow for my husband's cow's dairy intolerance. Wouldn't hesitate to use the company again.

Avoid at all costs if you want certainty that a chef will show up.I booked a chef through this company for a hen do in April months in advance. 7 days before my event I received an email saying that the chef assigned to my event was no longer available and was told that there were no other chefs available that evening. This was incredibly frustrating and stressful so close to the time, and with it being the key part of an event (as most of their bookings are) I had no flexibility. Finding another company in such short notice for a Saturday evening booking was not an option. I asked about other options and was told that they could keep looking for chefs, but couldn’t say the likelihood of being able to find one - not helpful when planning an event. Eventually I cancelled some other activities and reorganised the entire weekend to get a booking on the Friday night, and was given a 10% discount - not good enough in my opinion.At the time I thought this was a one off so didn’t write a review. However, my boyfriend (who is currently planning an event) has just had exactly the same thing happen to him, and was sent an email with exactly the same vaguely worded email which does not seem to be a coincidence! He is now left 9 days before an event (again a Saturday evening) which he cannot rearrange, and has been told that they will keep looking for a chef and that there is a “50/50 chance of finding one”.Looking at other reviews this seems to be a recurring problem with others having the same issue. It’s simply not good enough and for a company that specialises in providing an indulgent experience for special events, cancelling a booking with such short notice should never be considered acceptable.I appreciate that some last minute situations can’t be helped, but the company clearly has no feasible back up solution in place. To happen once could be excused but to happen twice (2 out of 2 bookings) is outrageous.This is no reflection on the chefs - who have been great, but the company has shocking management, they’re clearly overbooking events and should have enough back up chefs to ensure that this situation never happens. They can only help you if you rearrange your entire weekend or event to work around their schedule."

I used a few other meal prep companies before but they all made the mistake of giving just ingredients which I had to cook myself. KBK cook all the meals themselves and all I have to do is warm them up and they’re perfect. Takes a lot of decisions out of my day (choosing and cooking food) which at my level of busyness, is everything."

In comparison to other cleanses, this didn't give me any headaches, and not once did I feel hungry. However I didnt feel quite as revitalised as I'd hoped after the 5days, I still felt quite bloated. And during the cleanse on some occasions I did get some cramping in my legs (possibly this was my body detoxing).

Bonus was I felt good and lost a few pounds too.  Then started their 3 meals a day meal plan (lean plan) Wasn’t sure about a few meal choices (just me being a fussy eater) but now you can swap out meals your not keen on its great.  Meals come in microwave boxes, so quick and easy and no washing up after !.  Meals were very tasty and I tried things I would never usually eat.  You can pause subscription whenever you like so very flexible. Customer service was amazing.  Highly recommend,  If there was one negative it was that delivery courier didn’t keep boxes flat so some of the yoghurt based breakfasts or oats ones got sloshed about but that’s the couriers not being careful nothing the company could really do about it.  I’m definitely doing it again when return from holiday. Thanks KBK team"

It's incomparable better quality that the meals that I used to buy in supermarkets; and it's calorie counted which I like.For me it is very convinient, life is a bit hectic at the minute, working 7 days/week and no time whatsoever for cooking ( even if I would've had time, I couldn't cook as good), so I know that the food is coming every week; very happy with the delivery aswell. And the packaging is brilliant for recycling. Another brilliant aspect of KBK is their customer service. I have some holidays planned and I needed to pause the plan for a while.

The juices are so delicious (Verde and Zen are my favourites!!) and really do keep you satisfied, after the 2 days I felt so good that I wished I had committed to a longer cleanse. So the month after I ordered the 3 days. The cleanse really helped me with bloating and gives your digestive system time to heal and recover from any overindulgence, as a side bonus I also lost a few pounds!! Their prices are also really competitive compared to other companies, I would highly recommend anyone to order from KBK, and I will definitely be ordering from them again, I might even try 5 days next time!"

The food quality is great and ‘clean’. It is healthy wholesome food I would choose for myself and there is no food waste. I selected 3x meals a day M-F, delivered Sunday by DPD who also are great with notifications and service. Having recently been diagnosed with ADHD, the time & mental energy that these meals have given back to me is priceless. No more lists, planning, shopping (even online shopping!), making meals and then leaving them at home. I can focus solely on my job and if I do get a break I can now use it for a post lunch walk. I have stopped skipping lunch, spending a fortune in the canteen or getting a late takeaways. Good nutrition is essential for mental performance and this breaks that vicious cycle. I am less stressed and also less bloated. I chose 1400 cal plan: Breakfast, lunch & dinner plan with no changes or preferences and all the meals so far have been lovely. You can pre select meals each week before they close the menus for delivery. I have tried meal deliveries before but the quality of meals has never been this excellent. I have also tried meal prep deliveries but these usually only provide lunch & dinners and they still require effort. I have found my absolute non-negotiable for managing ADHD with a busy full time job and I’m also a few kgs down (which was not the goal, but I can definitely spare them!) I also love the zero food waste, the fully recyclable cardboard packaging, once the plastic film is peeled off. The local animal shelters love the 100% recycled fabric insulation they are packed in."

I’ve managed to lose weight with them, it has saved me so much time, hassle, no washing up, and even better, THEY HAVE NOW LAUNCHED A MEAL SELECTOR! I couldn’t be happier. Here are my pros:- Glad you have the ingredients seperated in the dish e.g I can pick out onions or chillis if I wished- Love it is a different meat for each day for lunch and dinner- Always delivered on time by dpd (although they don’t always follow instructions, but not your fault)- Always have every meal in the order, none ever missing- if I don’t feel like selecting my meals, I like there is a menu each week for each day rather than leaving it to me to put together - I once had my box delivered with all meals in order of the menu which was amazing (hats off to the packer!)- LOVE that you don’t have just rice with every meal and there are differing carb types for each one- Like the pasta dishes the most- Your customer service team is second to none! Helen in particular has been amazing to me in the past. - easy to pause and restart if going on holiday etcDislikes:- in all honesty, now that you can select your meals it has eliminated any that I may have had. - the only one that would be nice is if the meals are pre-loaded into MyFitnessPal so I could just search and selectOverall, keep up the amazing work team you’ve created something amazing here and I will be staying a happy, loyal customer for the foreseeable!"

I signed up with the goal of losing some weight. I chose their 'Get Lean' plan, initially choosing the option of 3 meals a day + a snack. I've since however changed this to 2 meals a day, due to wanting to increase my weight loss. This was very easy to do, I just sent them an email and the next day I had a reply with my plan being changed.As for the actual food and the deliveries. The food itself I think is very good. It all comes very well packaged, in recyclable packaging, with everything clearly labeled. The actual ingredients you can tell are quality ingredients and are all prepared with care. It all tastes very good, it's not rich gourmet food, you do have to remember it's a diet plan, so they obviously have to use healthier ingredients and less fats and oils, etc. But for healthy food I think it all tastes very good, it's all very clean, light and easy to digest and it definitely makes you feel healthier. I do have some minor complaints about the food however, the breakfasts were a bit hit and miss, they had certain things like bacon and eggs,  pancakes and wraps, etc, which were all very good and enjoyable, but then they also have other things that I personally was not a fan of, such as chai seed porridge and overnight oats. I found these personally to be a bit too bitter, tart and sour tasting. Other people might find them enjoyable though. I also think the food on the whole tends to be a bit too fashionable and a bit too trendy, opting for more exotic kinds of flavours instead of simple or classical British ones. There's a lot of Asian, Italian, Indian, Middle Eastern, African and even Caribbean inspired dishes. Instead of them having say, a simple beef stew, it's an Italian stew with black olives, or instead of sausage and mash with onion gravy, it's Caribbean sausages with sweet potato mash and a pineapple sauce. There's a lot of chili and spice, a lot of sweet, sour and unusual flavours. Now there's nothing wrong with this, it's nice actually to try different flavours and things you're not used to, but it would be nice to also include some classical British dishes as well. Another thing that I wasn't impressed by is the snacks. On my initial week I received flapjacks, falafels and some kind of oat/berry snack. The flapjacks were around 300-350 calories each, which is very high calorie for a snack. The falafels were around 200 and something, which was more reasonable. I forget what the berry things were, but after that, the only snacks I received were either flapjacks, brownies or blondies, admittingly different flavours each time, such as coconut, chocolate or some kind of fruit, but still I expected more variety. Worst still is that these were also very high calorie, on average around 350. For a diet plan and for something that's advertised as a 'heathy snack', I think these were too high in calorie. To put it in perspective, you could have a 48g Snickers Bar and have it be only 245 calories. So I feel like these snacks could actually hinder someone's weight loss, and it's why I personally chose to stop them myself and change to just 2 meals a day.My last criticism is about the green vegetable content within the meals. A lot of the times a meal might include broccoli or some other type of green vegetable, but it can be just one single piece of broccoli floret at times, which I do find to be a bit stingy. Especially if you're someone like me, who's using this as a meal replacement program and as such wants to make sure you're receiving your appropriate vitamins. I also feel with vegetables, especially green ones, being of such low calorie, they could easily up the quantity that they provide.All in all though these are minor complaints and I'm very happy with the meals, they taste great and I am losing weight, their customer support is also top notch and clearly care, regularly checking in with how you're doing, so yeah, I definitely recommend them."

He was super smartly dressed and really didn't need any help as he made his way around the kitchen to check what equipment we had then got to work.Food: This was perfect. 4 courses of Turkish themed dining delivered to perfection. All the dips and bits were hand made on the day which was great and everything was super fresh. Halloumi was amazing and with huge portions and great flavours. The Lamb was tender and moist and full of subtle spices, with all the sides complementing it perfectly. Desert was great with a magically paired ice cream. Sam announced each course one by one with a nice description of what to expect/notice.After: Sam was on top of the washing up and cleaning as he went and so left everything as he had found it. He wasn't rushed or hurrying us and so went on his way around 10:30 without any hassle or crashing around our table of drunk people.Overall: Fantastic group dining option with a perfect chef."

Confirmation came through that Maria would be our chef for the evening.Communication with Maria was excellent. Maria offered 3 menus to choose from, with the option to mix and match courses.Maria was very flexible regarding timing for the meal and assisted in getting our booking upgraded from 2 to 4 people.Maria was very professional and polite throughout the evening and such great fun to talk to.The food was cooked to perfection and beautifully presented.After the meal Maria washed and dried everything and left the kitchen area spotless. My wife is very OCD when it comes to food hygiene, and even she was impressed!Our choice of dishes wasPoached figs with mozarrela and Serrano ham, on a bed of green leaves.If I'm going to be critical, I would this could have been improved with some shavings of stronger hard cheese, as I personally find mozarella too mild. however the figs and Serrano more than made up for that.Main course was loin of lamb with rhubarb and caramalised onion compote, served with baked shallots. Superb flavours.And to round it off, we were treated to Marias spiced apple tart a beautiful fusion of flavours, not too sweet or sour, and best of all not pureed apple but wholesome half apples baked to perfection. This was served with a homemade vanilla ice.Portion sizes were just right, it made a change to appreciate a good meal without ending up feeling uncomfortably full. (And there was a large portion apple tart left over). Most of that as gone now!!!Would we like Maria to cook for us again?... most definitelyA wonderful experience.Thankyou Maria."

Seminar.","DO NOT BOOK WITH LA BELLE. They sent out a notice to all bookings at the end of May that they were shutting down operations and that the website would be completely unavailable as of June 15th. We had our elopement dinner booked with a chef through them that we were then scrambling to find an alternative for. In the meantime, we requested a refund. After a nightmare of going back and forth over a dozen times with them, with no responses or vague responses with no follow through, I was finally able to get the refund processed- but they kept their booking fee. They decided to send out an email on June 8th- 3 days after they have disabled their website for users to manage their bookings- that they had decided they could maintain operations. But by that point, we’d already managed to book the same chef through another platform. I’ve now requested them to refund the booking fee multiple times, but they claimed they could still meet the booking so they didn’t have to, and I’ve already told them that’s not possible since that chef isn’t available to them on that night since we booked him elsewhere. They are no longer responding to any messages I’ve sent requesting the remaining balance. This business practice is completely unacceptable and untrustworthy. Do not risk your event with this shady business."

My only complaint is that there was one desert missing,  the waiter looked and noticed but did not appear with one or an explanation.  As it turned out my son wasn't bothered so we let it go.

A little on the pricey side at £2.33 a mouthful. Tasty nonetheless. Here is my breakdown per course:APPETISERGazpacho shot, salted cod fishcake with aioli- Absolutely delicious, beautifully presentedSTARTERSaffron and parmesan risotto with truffle oil- Didn't have saffron but did a workaround with asparagus and was delicious.MAIN COURSEFillet steak, parma ham crisp & garlic rosti potato, roasted vine cherry tomatoes, charred spring onions, Buttered Kale, Bearnaise Sauce- Okay, the steak was lovely and was serviced with the rosti, tomoatoes, spring onions and sauce but there was no parma ham or buttered kale! Not sure what happened and we only realised afterwards that these were never served with the meal...DESSERTClassic Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bean ice cream, butterscotch sauce- Homemade and delicious. The chef left us with the rest of the sticky toffee pudding sponge!CHEESEPlatter of British cheeses with chutney and artisan biscuits- Lovely and well presented.Overall a lovely experience and delicious food, but shame about the missing elements which we had paid for!"

People happily turned away by hostess.Manager said she would handle any complaints raised via website and there is no way of escalating this to head office. Families with small children sitting on laps waiting  for no apparent reason.Different staff members gave us different reasons for the wait - one said it was because of backlog in deliveroo orders whereas the manager said deliveroo was switched off.

We both ordered food at the same time but only my boyfriend’s came after about 20 mins. He had then finished his meal and I was still waiting. About 40 minutes after we’d ordered I asked about my food. The waiter was lovely and followed it up and immediately brought me out my food with some complimentary chips. Unfortunately, due to my food being sat overlooked, it was quite cold. I’ve never had a problem like this before at Nando’s but this was my experience at this one."

They said they could offer me a refund for the missing item. I then rang the store and they said they were now out of stock and would ring me when it was back. Rang me and it still wasn’t back on the website. Finally got to order the item again through Deliveroo. Had to pay 2 times for delivery and had taken 1:30 hours for me to be able to order the meal again. Appalling

This has been pointed out to the management but they can't even be bothered to get the vacuum cleaner out!Not good enough."

The answer I got “the other till is not working” & walk away. ok!!!!! I ask for my wings & fries to be cooked well done. This seems to be an in going issue as this happens pretty well every time we have used Nando’s. Hold & behold it was not done again!! There were two other tables that sat before us & they got their order first. Had to ask if someone can check on our order & that is when the order was delivered to our table. Both our food were cold! We were going out so had no time to send it back. I did not eat my meal! That was the last straw for us to visit Nando’s in South Woodford or for that matter any Nando’s .

I’ve tried to call the customer service number again but this goes to VM and refers you back to the nandos website, I have emailed them on insta twice and still no reply.

An absolutely awful customer experience, so we walked out, never to return! Shame really, because we are also in the market for booking groups in local restaurants...

Oh no it isn't as you get bullied into having a nandos card. I didnt want a nandos card, we werent starting a relationship i only wanted to order chicken. So now with the unwanted nandos card in my Google wallet, i think I'll be able to place the order now. Of course i couldn't. My previously full basket prior to the enforced sign up was now empty. I'm fuming by now, but when a girl wants spicy chicken she is prepared to keep pushing forward. So as i go to pay.... i couldnt, as each time i tried to go through verification, the payment window closes and expects you to start all over again.

Rainbow slaw was just dried up cabbage and carrot without any dressing and the chips with soggy and cold. Later that day I had a terrible upset stomach and nausea.

Took my son ice skating across the road from here and thought Nandos would be a lovely treat afterwards.The constant questions when being seated feels like harassment. Yes I know how to order I’ve been to Nandos before and replied yes when asked but was still giving a verbal manual on everything.Heard they were bringing out Mac n cheese so wanted to try but was rudely told “it’s not on the menu yet”. So abruptly, no mention as to when it will be available.The small Asian lady is very very rude and unapproachable. The staff don’t seem like they are treated with respect and the managers seem to point to things they want done rather than giving a helping hand. It’s a very small space so chaotic with no order. Chips over cooked, brown mash they tried to cover up by folding over and sauce bottles with sauce all over it. Unpleasant dining experience. Upstairs by the toilets there’s a nice outside seating area with a view but no one can eat there?????? Nandos has gone downhill"

Went to tills to ask only to be told that there was no chicken, which didn't make sense .One worker then apologised to me as he saw that I was fumming, he promised to give us our order in 5 mins , which he did.

A restraunt that will not serve tepid water hiding behind the guise of “ health and safety” and to top it all off we are still sat here waiting for food! Totally unacceptable and an absolute disgrace especially when we regularly frequent this place and other Nando’s restaurants and have never ever had a problem with obtaining tepid water!

Then to finally get my our food where the order wasn’t right and covered in grease that had leaked and missing items.

It was like ruffled chickens in a disgruntled hen house watching myself politely challenge the status quo.Disappointed I really wouldn't go to Nandos anymore it's declined. The Nandos abroad are better value and better quality. The only thing that was truly nice was the spiced nuts. The salad was unpleasant but I ate it because I was so hungry. I now have indigestion.

We were greeted with Connor who was just so bubbly energetic and really got us out of the little mood we were in! They both checked on us through the meal while cracking some quirky jokes ect it was all around just a brilliant experience! Please give them a pay rise as they understand completely what customer satisfaction is ￼& exactly what the customers want! I will definitely be back to see them both! Thanks again to you both for cheering us up and giving us an outstanding service of stand up comedy & excellent food, 2 for the price of one! ❤️"

The chickens must be on a diet as the 1/2 chicken was lean to say the least. Bit stingey on the spicy rice and the slaw was decent. Overall ok but £30 for 2 mains with sides does feel a bit punchy

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-08-16,Ash,Pretty shocking customer service,,"Pretty shocking customer service. I selected a specific restaurant in Cardiff as it provides halal food on the website for delivery. But as soon as I made the payment, I received an email saying it was being handled by the non-halal restaurant. I called customer service immediately and I was informed that my order was already prepared so I couldn't cancel. This was in the space of 3 or 4 minutes from the moment the payment went through. I had to hang up as the customer agent said I had selected the wrong restaurant and their systems cannot be wrong. I am adamant this was not my mistake as I double checked the restaurant. The Deliveroo driver was really great though. He tried to fix it from his side, but I had ordered from Nando's website, so there wasn't anything he could do, except offer to give the food to homeless people! (He couldn't eat the food either as he also ate halal)I am pretty upset and I have already made a formal complaint. I am willing to take this further if I don't at least get an apologyUpdate: Nando's have refunded me, which is good. But they're still blaming me for their system's mistake."

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2022-11-04,Kay,"Constant burnt chicken, and no refund!",,"It came to a point where everytime I ordered from them online I would get burnt chicken. Due to this I ordered from them less and less. They are the only delivery place I know of that sell somewhat healthy food that tastes good ‘usually’ so I kept waiting a period of time in between all of the mishaps, hoping it would improve (as they promised it would). They gave me a refund a few times and apologised profusely and stated that ‘this does not meet with their standard’, then all of a sudden they said that they will no longer refund me and that clearly I just don’t like how they cook their chicken. I questioned them, as they were contradicting the fact that they had previously acknowledged on a number of occasions that the chicken was below their standard and encouraged me to try again as it would improve. But they refused to give me a refund, insinuated I should stop ordering from them and then they started to ignore my complaint emails. I am extremely disappointed and they were very rude. If anyone knows of ‘healthier’ options, ‘grilled food’ delivery options- please let me know!"

Had to wait 30 mins while snaller groups went ahead. Welcome girl on the door taking walk ins looked like she was getting ready to leave, had a puffa coat on and training shoes the whole time.  She was pleasant enough (not overly forthcoming or confident tho). She looked scruffy to me and not a good first impression of the company. While waiting for a table Couldn't  order drinks to be added to a bill. When finally seated had to order via an app from the table. So had to decide all food in one go! Then after that which was stressful doing everyone's  order we couldn't pay via the app with our meal gift cards! So had to then go over the order again at the till. Had to get your own cutlery, sauces, napkins! What a joke. Going out should be a pleasant experience of being waited on and having a personal touch. Found it quite stressful  and all we wanted was to relax and enjoy the company  of friends while being served a delicious meal. Won't  be back. This is  not eatimg out in style its eatimg out vile (tho the food was tasty) The staff were plesant enough but they don't  really do much as its more do it yourself. Couldn't  leave a tip unless it was for our own hard work lol! I think the whole experience needs to be looked at , can i suggest a choice of service, while i appreciate some people are happy to do all the work i certainly aren't.

Then miss bull buck and duppy aka CHLOE the deputy MANAGER came over and was very defensive and rude!!! I put everything in the bag she said…I checked them off myself….with a very rude tone,I said to her why would I drive 10 minutes back for chips if you put them in the bag and all the rest of the food is getting cold? I told her to go and check the camera…She shout well I put them in the bag! So I said are you saying that I’m lying? She said just to let you know you’re not welcome at this nandos ever again… I said what? because I complained about you guys keep messing up peoples orders and it happened to me multiple times, I got pissed off and told her I ain’t dealing with her anymore because Courtney was sorting it out for me… she stormed off! I said to Courtney she should be the Manager because she knows how to defuse a situation than making it worse. CHLOE NEEDS TO BE CLEANING NANDOS TOILETS AND NOT BE ON FRONT END!

Her attitude was stinking and smug from the get go ‘Abigail’ apparently it’s a matter of opinion if it was cold or not !! This person had absolutely zero managerial skills and as I said above a disgusting attitude! When asked who her manager was to complain about her we were told there was no manager in she’s it !! Another guy Shaun came over who said she was the manager and if we care to email she will be the one who contacts us and this point he was told not a chance we want her manager .. Ni appeared (the general manager who wasn’t in the store) To be fair she was nice but didn’t really take the complaint on board of her managers attitude said things got heated (correct) but ONLY due to the way we were spoken to! Absolutely disgusted with the whole experience.. In my eye if someone is complaining and sending there food back for being cold (sorry like warm at best) .. I certainly wouldn’t be arguing with them that it wasn’t .. I would be apologetic of the service and explain its not a usual service that we give .. but no no Abigail was most definitely up for an argument Shame nandos employee such people or make them managersThankfully frankie and bennys were accommodating food was lovely and HOT"

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-11-23,Wei Liu,Worst customer service I have ever experienced,,"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the service I received at your Guildford restaurant on 23 Nov 2023 at 4pm. I placed an order through the Nando's app for collection after a day of Christmas shopping. As I was carrying several large bags, I decided to use the seat by the counter to wait for my order.Despite arriving at the restaurant on time, I was kept waiting for an additional 15 minutes beyond the estimated pickup time. During this time, a group of dine-in customers arrived. An Asian-looking female employee approached me and asked if I would mind standing up and waiting by the door, despite the fact that the restaurant was relatively empty and there were many other seats available.This employee then proceeded to prioritize packing orders for Deliveroo customers, completely ignoring my presence and consistently displaying a dismissive attitude. I was appalled by her behavior and felt that I was being treated as a lesser customer simply because I had chosen to order my food for collection.I am a loyal Nando's customer and have always been satisfied with the service I have received at other branches. However, my experience at your Guildford restaurant has left me feeling deeply disappointed and undervalued. I urge you to take immediate action to address this issue and ensure that all customers, regardless of their order type, receive the same level of respect and consideration.Please do provide your staff with sufficient training on customer service and cultural sensitivity."

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-10-28,Rihab Al Seyab,Bad treatment and ricem against me in Nando's Cheltenham,,"I am 60 years old lady from middle East origin. Today, Saturday, October 28, at five o’clock in the evening, I invited my family to have dinner at Nando’s Cheltenham on the occasion of my daughter’s 16th birthday in Cheltenham city center.  There was a tall blonde girl on the entrance, perhaps 18 years old,  I asked her for a table for three people. She pointed to the location of the table, and it was inappropriate, small, and located in the corridor. So I asked her to move to another table after it was finished, and it was occupied by 3 people. She made an excuse and said that it was only for two people, and she lifted the third chair.  Then I saw two white people moved from their table to another table without taking her permission, and she did not speak to them or stop them.  Another table was empty for 6 people, so she called white woman with her child who was waiting at the entrance and gave her the table. After that, another table was empty for four people, so I asked a black waitress to move, and she agreed. After we moved, the first blonde waitress came and refused to let us sit there and asked to return to our first table, so I asked her about  The reason and why she said it was for four people and you are three, knowing that at that time no one was waiting at the entrance and she spoke to us with arrogance and contempt and did not prohibit us because we were old.  Then she called another person who worked with her and claimed to be the manager. He was very agitated and treated us with arrogance and contempt and asked us to return to our first table or leave the restaurant.  Then the security man brought us and ordered us to leave by force.  We were treated with clear racism, as we were of non-European origin, by the blonde cartoonist and her colleague.  Note that we have been regular customers of Nando's restaurant since 2003 in Britain, the Sultanate of Oman, Dubai and others.  This was the first time we were treated this way in a restaurant in Britain, and they did not respect our age. I am 69 years old and my husband is 77 years old. They disturbed the peace of our night, and we began to celebrate our daughter’s birthday. We became nervous and drowned in our joy.  Note that I am a university professor and my husband is a professor. We hold a British passport and have been working and living here since 2002. We have not faced racist treatment in any other restaurant, as happened in your restaurant, the Chelntham branch, tonight."

When I realised her mistake, I went back and talk to someone and waited good 5 minutes then talked to Nicola ( one of the manager she claimed). She just told me that is fine you just pay for a 1/4 chicken which I was agreed, but they wanted to charge me £5.25. I told her this is not right. Why do I have to pay £5.25 when Nandos deducted only £3.50 from bill which I did not asked to do that. She told me that she can not do it through her touch screen till, but happy to write her name and give me free next time ( postponed the problem and their incompetent). I explained, that I had an issue and your manger wrote his name but it not resolved. She was aggressive and expected me to accept their mistake. Finally, she accept her mistake and gave me my 1/4 chicken. And when I told her she was wrong she told me ""WHATEVER"" which I could accept. We have been Nandos customer in past 25 years, but I could sense that they are failing their customers with poor customer service. When my wife talked to Nicola, she admitted that they have decided to deduct from bills in their meeting which is not right. They have increased prices and size of their chicken smaller than KFC and even Marlys. They have also increase their reward for whole chicken from 3 to 4. I will complain to their head office and share my experience on their Facebook page and tweeter account as well as trust pilot. We gave it try one more time today 31/07/23, but everything has changed to absolutely ripped off place. When thier manager couldn't resolve their mistake, blamed cashier and his English. New and usual level of dishonesty and poor customer service with hidden agenda to not give your peri peri reward for any stupid readon yiu could imagen such as he didn'tunderstand English etc"

2,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-11-03,Sean,Shockingly Poor Customer Service,,"We went out for a family meal last night to Nandos (Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth).  Arriving around 7pm we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  After spending 10 minutes or so deciding what to eat my Dad and Sister went to the counter to order.Dad and his partner did not want a starter and my Sister had olives, but I then had to wait over half an hour for just some sweet potatoes.  Not the best start.  Fortunately the main course arrived just as I was finishing my starter, but that was still another 15 minutes.After finishing the main course we decided we would have a dessert so Dad went back to the counter, ordered (4 Pastel de Natas & 2 Choc-A-Lot cakes), and paid.  There was nothing that should have taken long to prepare especially considering the Pastel de Natas were in a display case at the service counter.We then waited a further 1/2 hour and the desserts still had not arrived so Dad went back to the counter to chase the order, then came back and sat at the table.  5 minutes or so later one of the staff came over and advised that they only had 1 Pastel de Nata left and advised that if we still wanted them we would have to wait for more to be cooked, or we could pick something else or have a refund.  After a brief discussion we decided on a refund for those items.We then waited yet another 15 minutes (possibly more) and the Choc-A-Lot cakes had still not arrived (though they had brought Dad's refund over) so Dad went back to the counter to chase again and advised that if the cakes weren't going to be ready in the next 5 minutes he wanted a refund.  He came and sat back down.The cakes finally arrived about 5 minute later (running total of at least 50 minutes waiting time just for dessert).  It was now about 9:50pm.A few minutes later another staff member came over (presumably a manager), knelt beside Dad, and started (politely) berating him for shouting at one of the girls at the service counter who he had apparently made cry.  Dad just nodded.Now in all of my life I don't think I have ever heard my Dad shout.  He is over 80 now, hard of hearing, and won't wear his hearing aid as he finds it too uncomfortable; as a result of this speaks quite loudly sometimes, but he has never, in my experience, shouted at anybody.  I, on the other hand, am quite capable of raising my voice should the need arise so I stayed out of the conversation.We asked Dad what the manager had said and he shrugged and confirmed he had only heard a few words.While I understand the desire to protect your staff, not only did the manager not get both sides of the story here and therefore made a completely one-sided snap judgement, but he virtually completely failed to acknowledge the utterly abysmal service we had received that evening.It should not take 3 hours to serve 3 small courses especially as the restaurant, while full at the start of the evening, was half empty by the time we had ordered our desserts.When you have clearly run out of a dessert item, is it not common sense to go to the kitchen and request more or, if there is no more, tell the customer and ask them to choose something else?Had Dad not gone to chase the food twice we would have been waiting the until closing as they had clearly completely forgotten about us.Unsurprisingly, none of us will ever be visiting Nandos again!"

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-08-16,David Haddad,My recent experience with Nando's…,,"My recent experience with Nando's online order left me feeling extremely disappointed and dissatisfied. Not only did they make a mistake with my order by providing regular chips instead of the large ones I had requested, but their customer service response was far from satisfactory. Despite acknowledging their error, Nando's refused to replace the chips or offer a refund for the portion of difference. This negative encounter has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I feel compelled to share my experience in this review.I decided to order from Nando's through their online platform for convenience. The process itself was relatively straightforward, allowing me to select the items I desired and customise my order according to my preferences. However, it is worth noting that the accuracy of the final order is crucial in ensuring customer satisfaction.Upon arriving at the restaurant to pick up my order, I was disheartened to discover that Nando's had made a mistake. Instead of receiving the large chips I had paid for, I was given regular-sized chips. This discrepancy was immediately noticeable and disappointing, as it meant I did not receive what I had paid for.Naturally, I contacted Nando's customer service to address the issue and seek a resolution. While they apologized for the inconvenience caused, their response fell short of what one would expect from a reputable establishment. Despite admitting their mistake, they were unwilling to replace the chips or provide a refund for the difference in price between regular and large chips.The lack of accountability displayed by Nando's in this situation is truly disheartening. As a customer who placed an online order and paid for specific items, it is only fair to expect that those items are delivered accurately. When mistakes happen, it is essential for businesses to take responsibility and rectify the situation promptly."

Mine is always the same, a footlong meatball sub with extra cheese but when I started eating it wasn’t the amazing marinara meatball taste explosion that I remembered, it literally tasted like crap. My wife started using Google to see if we could find out why and we found out that Subway have changed the meat in the meatballs for a cheaper meat and you can tell it’s different which has totally ruined subway for me. Using a cheaper meat but still charging the same! and because of that I can honestly say I won’t be eating at subway again."

When I got there they were shut, with their opening hours clearly displayed on the window that confirmed, yep, they should have been opened. I wrote into Subway (online) to ask for an explanation as to why the restaurant decided to close when it advertised itself as being open during those hours. Received a generic reply about their range of food and that they would pass on my feedback to the restaurant. My response back was something along the lines of ""could you please address my specific complaint as the response I have received is clearly a generic reply?"" Weeks later, no further response. One the day of visiting the (closed) restaurant, I went to the competitor across the road who WERE open when they said they would be. Not alot to ask.All in all, poor experience. They decide to close when they want, and the online complaints team don't even read and address the complaints. I complained to Subway first, they weren't interested, so here you go Trust Pilot."

He was rude and passive aggressive. I asked to speak to the manager and this just made things worse as she was annoyed at me for complaining and was trying to stand up for him, making excuses for his behaviour which is just not acceptable. It’s been a long time since I’ve experienced customer service as bad as this. Ended up walking out. Obviously will never return. Would rate 0 stars if I could."

I've grown to use them less and less, and my rating/recent experience is borne out of frustration with subway rewards. I had enough for a sandwich, and seemingly none of their stores will take them. A rewards program isn't worthwhile if it doesn't cover all your stores - no doubt they've spent a fortune on designing a loyalty programme & related app/marketing to be considerably worse than stamped cardboard. I gave up and uninstalled their app, tried to unsubscribe from the emails. After unsubscribing they continued to email me & said go to ""update your preferences"" instead. Regardless of browser, this seems to give 503 errors when logging in. So I'm getting emailed about a rewards programme that doesn't work in multiple ways."

They pointed to the allergen info but none of the breakfast things were on it! Both our subs were virtually empty. One rasher of bacon and invisible cheese. Very dry with large patches of bread with nothing on it at all. The staff were miserable and the lady actually threw mine across the counter at me and the paper half came off. Absolutely rubbish.

Moronic employees.,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"I used to be a big fan of subway when they gave you a decent size sandwich and had the subway melt (turkey,bacon and ham) on the menu (UK). That's all In the past! Now they sometimes measure the salad or give you 2 half olives in a foot long. They have a new version of 'subway melts' that only come on specific bread and you cannot add any salad. Which I was unaware and given a rude answer when I asked for salad.For the past 5 years the people have become more moronic and it's like they don't realise that someone has to actually eat the sandwich they are making. Now I don't go there at all out of spite and anger even though if they made a decent size it would still be a tasty meal. I am fed up of big companies just being about profit and greed and have lost the values of why people went there in the first place. I hope it goes out of business and get what it deserves."

There was no apology from them & then put the order at the back of the queue. This is completely out of order. I believe the service that I received fell way short of what I expect from Subway.

I'm normally a very satisfied regular customer of Subway in Braintree and have eaten at others too. I normally find the salad boxes very filling and good value for money. In fact I'm known so well in Braintree subway I Just have to ask for my regular. The owner knows exactly what I'm having. Yesterday's experience in Saffron Walden was very different. I paid for double grilled chicken but got standard size and the salad box was half the normal size I've had everywhere else. My wife's salad box was also just as pathetic and were both left hungry afterward and had to purchase more food elsewhere. I assume it's owner run and managed and every salad leaf and cucumber slices is being counted. Bad move as I definitely won't return for this rip off side salad.

Three staff repeated got the order wrong, the order was a simple foot long turkey and ham sub with extra poached egg cheese and toasted. They tried to add egg to only half the sub without asking if egg was wanted in both halfs. When they were told I wanted egg in both halves they just grabbed an egg and throw it in not even cut up.The staff ignored the order and went to serve the next customer. I had to stop them online order were prioritised over customer in front of them too.  My wife ordered two chicken tikka wraps they forgot to add cheese and the same woman that was in charge of the other two told them they forgot the cheese and put on a different cheese with it being toasted.

I have to say that when it comes to customer service, this place is the pits. The girl making the sandwich was fine. The red-haired girl at the till (1st Oct 23 @ 12.00) was so ignorant and rude. I was standing there for a couple of minutes whilst she completely ignored me and carried on talking to her mate. No. 'I'll be with you in a minute', no eye contact, nothing! I felt like I shouldn't be there! Then, when she did finally serve me, again, no eye contact. She really shouldn't be working there. Perhaps a non customer facing role would suit her? Also, when did Subway decide to change their prices so that it's almost a tenner (£8.69) for what is essentially, just a flipping sandwich!  That's just not worth the price, in my opinion, so I'll vote with my feet in the future."

Once I came out I showed her my card. I user a Walker so it can be seen I have problems but unfortunately other issues are hidden disabilities. This us the 2nd time I have gone in this store and felt I have to beg to use the toilet. I understand the policy of customers only as people have been known to go in there and wreck it. But can staff not be taught to use their discretion. It us very degrading having to beg for such a simple thing.

Two minutes later he still hadn't come out! I just said ""Forget it"", to which the girl said ""He's just changing his gloves""! No, the gloves are under the counter & it doesn't take more than 20 seconds to put gloves on! I walked out. Thank goodness Co-op was two doors down & I could get something there instead.

They kept a BMT & added a Baller (Meatball Marinara with pepperoni) but as they are they're now both £8.29 if I recall correctly, but then if you wanted to add the extras to either of those to make an original Mega Meat the price is a disgusting £9.89.1st week of the new menu I was only charged £8.19 for a BMT with Meatballs (Mega Meat) for some strange reason, but the following week they said £9.89 & stuck at that so I told them to eat it themselves & walked out, one fella began telling me I had to pay as they'd made the sandwich, he stopped talking & went back to his work though when I turned & gave him a look that simply said ""make me"".Never set foot in a Subway since & never will if they don't sort this BS out."

When I refused politely she reluctantly put through the sandwich and the correct price “a footling” instead of the 2 6inch she was fully committed to charging me for. As I sat to eat my food she came out and asked me to leave and that she had called the police as I was antisocial “her narrative”.I have been a loyal customer of subway for over 15 years and have spent a lot of money in your stores in this time. Ps: the partner of the area manager of this store who is the store manager accused of trying on with her partner who is the area manager on a night out in 2016 when I first came in the store 3 months ago. I was honestly glad she said tried it on and not slept with her partner as I have no recollection of this event she mentioned. I found this severely unprofessional from the area manager and store manager as I believe their influence led to this incident. I have always been respectful to all the staff and believe that they have abuse my kindness. I truly believe that I have been discriminated against because of the colour of my skin. The are manager contacted me on the 17th saying that they would look in this but no update to date. Shows what they think of their customers

I asked if the coffee machine was in service she said yes so I replied I would like a coffee. She ignored me and carried on chatting to her colleague I then said it does not take 2 people to serve 1 person as I just want a coffee which would take less than 5 minutes to make. The colleague then said she’s not working ???? Well if the colleague was not working why was she behind the counter chatting when customers are in store waiting and being ignored? She then started to shout at me and accused me of having an attitude when it was very clear I asked for a coffee only to her member of staff who was doing nothing .She told her not to serve me and I must leave the shop. At this point I am confused as to was this woman problem in me asking her colleague for a coffee that I always come in and purchase . This was so unpleasant unprofessional and rude of this woman to talk to myself as a customer this way which I will not be accepting. Manager was on site he decided to come out and make my coffee without asking what was going on and not saying anything in English to his member of staff . This is what I find very insulting as I speak English very fluently and why not address the issue in English? Even on leaving the shop she was talking about me in her language. Manager  did not apologise or anything .

I requested said employee name to which he refused and removed his name badge advised he can do what he likes as this is his shop then sat behind the counter attempting to tower over me (petit female) and raising voice. Then turns to a different employee and speaks in a different language before deciding I derseved a new sub! I complained to subway HQ who sent this to the franchisee to deal with. Upon contact with the franchisee who allegedly reviewed cctv has only recounted particular moments of the exchange especially by advising I am the aggressor which is definitely not he case of course I’m annoyed I’ve wasted my whole journey time and money,  then to be verbally abused and patronised is going to be frustrating.

When I complained to the customer service team I received a stock reply email from Medallia (their feedback management company) with the usual platitudes about customer service being important but no actual answer as to what the company intended to do to resolve the complaint. I contact the managing director to highlight this and the director of operations contacted me to try to resolve the problem. I thought great a senior member of staff has taken ownership of the complaint and this will be dealt with promptly. How wrong I was, 6 months later and still no answers and the DO has stopped answering emails.

1,Subway,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-08-07,Frustrated,Subway just outside Ealing Broadway Station…,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"The main guy at the Subway just outside Ealing Broadway train station (I think he is the main guy there), is EXTREMELY brash, rude, impatient and condescending!! I recently started going via Ealing Broadway station on my dailycommute to and from work. I had bought a Tuna-something sandwich there on at least FOUR occasions before. On this particular day, I had ordered the SAME sandwich, and watched as it was being prepared. I noticed a very big difference in what he was putting into it, and I just assumed it was someone else's order, and NOT mine. It actually turned out to be mine, and I told him straight off that was not what I ordered at all. He told me that WAS what I ordered. I told him I had ordered for the same tuna sandwich on at least FOUR occasions, and it was NOT what he was offering me now!! He insisted I obviously did not know what I was talking about, and even went as far as telling me..""I am sure you can read, right?..."", referring to the posted menu, which stated a tuna canuha (or something like that) and which was what I ALWAYS ordered in the past. He then proceeded to point out to me a REGULAR tuna sandwich in much smaller print, and told him THAT must have been what I had always ordered!!!!! I told him I think I would know what I had asked for on at least FOUR occasions. He still insisted on his stance, and I could see the obvious look of embarrassment on the face of his assistant. He grudgingly agreed to change it, and just stormed off, asking his assistant to prepare it!!! I think he was was extremely rude and impolite by raising his voice at me, having that kind of argument with a customer in front of OTHER customers, and most of all, by insinuating that I COULD NOT READ and maybe that was why I got the order mixed up!!! I actually noticed that kind of behaviour to customers from him in the past..I just never imagined it would happen to me. Anyone attending that particular Subway, should be prepared to get a not-very-pleasant service from the older guy running the place."

1,Subway,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-07-22,Lilith Green,NEVER AGAIN!!!!,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with SUBWAY's appalling customer service, and I must say it was nothing short of a nightmare. After receiving my order, which took a mere 10 minutes to arrive as the store was practically next door, I was utterly disappointed to find that the food was stone cold. It was as if they couldn't even be bothered to ensure a basic level of quality for their customers.As if that wasn't bad enough, I ordered their 'Big Bombay' Sub, only to be served what can only be described as a microscopic sliver of chicken. It was laughable and downright insulting to call it a 'normal portion.' I decided to take matters into my own hands and walked over to the store to see if they could rectify the situation.However, instead of any semblance of concern or responsibility, the staff showed complete indifference to my plight. They brazenly shrugged off the issue and redirected the blame towards the delivery service, Just Eat. I didn't order from Just Eat; I ordered from SUBWAY, and it was their responsibility to ensure the quality of the food they served.Their solution to this abysmal situation? To nonchalantly suggest reheating the sub in the microwave. Are you kidding me? I could have done that at home if I wanted a microwaved meal. I expected a fresh, hot sandwich considering the proximity of the store, not a half-hearted attempt to salvage their terrible mistake.The worst part of the whole experience was the attitude displayed by the staff. They had zero time for my concerns, treating me as if my dissatisfaction was unwarranted. As a paying customer, I deserve respect and at least a modicum of empathy when something goes so terribly wrong with my order.I have been a loyal customer to SUBWAY in the past, but after this abysmal display of incompetence and arrogance, I will think twice before ever setting foot in one of their stores again. I wouldn't wish this kind of service on my worst enemy. If you value your time, money, and sanity, I strongly advise you to steer clear of this SUBWAY location and seek out a restaurant that actually cares about their customers."

1,Subway,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-09-11,Nitro Chaos,Dangerous and Exploitative,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"Before ever buying anything from 'Subway' please read this. I know someone in a regularly distressed state through working there (Billingham Town Centre).On a zero hours minimum wage contract a defenceless 5 ft woman is made to work the night shifts alone. It was mentioned when she took the job that youths can be a problem at night but they still practice this as it is 'decided' that one person is enough and two is too much cost and they chose to be open in an empty shopping precinct that is a magnet for trouble at night from gangs of youths. Last night a large gang stormed the shop helping themselves practically looting the place and hurling threatening abuse, around ten of them including about three girls. Alone and shaken after they'd gone the lone employee called the 'security' line - and got an answerphone. She left a message, 24 hours later still no response.She has to cash up the takings and lock up the premises leaving from the back door into a dark parking lot every night to walk home. (She once cut her foot there in the broken glass because they told her to wear light soft shoes instead of her preferred Doc Martens).Still in the shop, too terrified to leave, she contacted the store manageress who blandly replied that she would 'check the CCTV in the morning'(!). Pathetic and yet 24 hours later even that still hasn't happened.Meanwhile another gang came in  the next night, balaclavas, verbal abuse, the lot. Threatening one terrified person with no one to turn to left alone again. As they do regularly, in full knowledge of the shop manageress who allocates the work hours.This is all operating under Subways approved methods apparently. I wanted the number for the manageress or franchise owner or whatever the **** she happens to be but didn't get it. She would be getting told to get in her poxy shop right now so I could come down and leave her shaking in her boots with nobody to turn to as I tell her exactly what I think of her. She knows its a problem and a risk, that someone is in danger every night, someone they have hired to make lousy sandwiches not be a security guard taking on all comers. The 'uniform provided' to the employee is a handed down cap and T Shirt from a previous employee. One hand-me-down T Shirt and one hand-me-down cap, could have been worn with somebody with scurvy for all she knows.She is expected to work past the hours she is paid to clear out online orders for deliveries then finish with end of night tasks, sometimes up to two hours of her own time is given. She is also expected to be on call in a Whatsapp group to help other staff learning the job outside of her paid hours as are all of their staff. There isn't even a pay slip they get paid in cash in little bags that they have to attend to collect at a given time. Next time you feel like a Subway, think of how they treat people. I will never buy another as long as I live. They quickly took my comment down on social media but they can't hide, shame on them - it's disgusting.I contacted their customer service social media page and was asked for bank details and other personal information before they would discuss to verify having been a customer - needless to say they didn't get it, and needless to say they walked away from any dialogue. Utter disgrace of a so called company, should be banned from trading."

2,Subway,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-08-10,daniel,Disappointed by Rising Prices and Unexpected Charges,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"I have been a loyal customer of Subway for over a decade, consistently purchasing 2 to 3 subs a week on my lunch break at work. However, I must say that my recent experience has left me disheartened and questioning my loyalty to the brand. Over the years, I understand that prices naturally rise due to inflation, but the sharp increase I witnessed today was quite unexpected.During my visit to Subway in Willenhall, I was informed that an extra £2 would be added to my order simply for the inclusion of cheese. This news came as a surprise because cheese has always been a complimentary addition to my sub. Even more astonishing was the revelation that a single slice of regular cheese would now cost an additional £0.50. This sudden change in policy and the dramatic increase in prices have left me feeling dissatisfied.Taking into account the amount of money I've been spending at Subway every week (ranging from £20 to £30), these new charges have made me seriously reconsider the value I now receive for my money. While I understand that businesses must adjust their prices, the recent price hikes seem to have spiraled out of control. As a result, unfortunately, today marks the end of my consistent patronage at Subway.Throughout the years, I have enjoyed the convenience and quality that Subway has provided, but the recent changes in pricing have made me question the affordability of their subs. While I appreciate the need for businesses to adapt to economic conditions, the drastic increase in prices for simple additions such as cheese has left me disappointed.I would have appreciated more transparency regarding these price adjustments, as I was caught off guard by the unexpected charges. Rather than feeling satisfied with my meal, I now question the overall value that Subway provides.Despite my disappointment, I must acknowledge that Subway has consistently provided fresh ingredients and a wide range of customisable options for their sandwiches. The quality of their bread and the variety of toppings available allow for a personalised dining experience. Additionally, the staff has generally been friendly and efficient, ensuring that orders are promptly prepared.However, with the recent price hikes, the overall value proposition offered by Subway has been significantly weakened. While I have enjoyed my meals at Subway for many years, it is regrettable that increasing prices have ultimately led me to seek alternative options for my lunchtime cravings.In conclusion, my longstanding loyalty to Subway has been tested due to the excessive price increases and unexpected charges introduced. Despite the positive aspects of their fresh ingredients and customization options, I can no longer justify the cost of their subs in relation to the value received. It is with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to Subway and seek alternatives that better align with my budget and expectations."

I logged onto my account to check the status and it said they were still waiting to be dispatched.So followed an email from a rather angry customer who had to go into town on Christmas Eve afternoon to try and find something similar.On 28th December at 13:41 I received an email apologising for the inconvenience and would I like them to send the glasses again or a refund.  At 16:45 I received another email saying that the glasses had been dispatched.  Didn't get much chance to reply as I was walking in Scotland!The glasses are what I wanted so no problem there.  I am disappointed that I was told they would be dispatched on 19th, they weren't and when I emailed them they responded with the idea that they had been dispatched but I hadn't received them despite the status of my order was 'waiting to be dispatched' Then I was asked if I wanted another set of glasses sending (as though they had been sent in the first place) or a refund and without getting chance to reply they were sent.I was initially impressed because of their responses but by the end left disappointed them"

And 4 of the wine glasses were broken.This is the third order in a row that you have messed up, so it will be our last."

No explanation, or email to confirm.

I have been a loyal customer for over 6 years and never before had a problem.  My most recent experience has been stressful and a shocking surprise.  They have fobbed me off, blind sided me and will not co-operate.  I bought a very large fridge.  I needed an extra person to carry it into my property because I am disabled and cannot carry heavy things.  The fridge was just under 2 metres tall, 3/4 metre wide and the same deep.  I agreed to pay £73.75 (ex VAT) for the extra person plus £87.50 (ex VAT) for the disposal of the old fridge. The ""extra person"" did not come with the driver.  The new fridge didn't leave the van and the old fridge hasn't moved from its original position. They even claimed I had ""agreed to a restocking fee"", which I absolutely hadn't!"

I’ve used it the next day it arrived trying to mince 5kg of pork shoulder and it was a disaster. Some sort of black lubricant came out from behind the auger and into my meat so I had to chuck everything away. The next day I have called Nisbets customer service and I told them and email them about the problem with pictures and video but instead of apologising and offer me a replacement or refund they chose to tell me that they will repair it. So I have paid £600 for a brand new Bufallo meat grinder to get a faulty one and being told I have to stuck with a repaired machine. Ohh well bad luck I guess. But don’t worry it’s only £600 so not a big deal right? One thing they seem to forget is that The Consumer Rights Act 2015 states that goods should be as described, of a satisfactory quality and fit for the purpose. As the item is not they are in breach of contract. I'm disgusted at this level of service from Nisbets. The grinder is with them for two weeks now and no updates. They don’t even send a courtesy email to say the machine arrived at our repair facility and our engineers are looking to fix it or what the fault was. So I suggest to take your business elsewhere unless you want to pay for brand new equipment and get faulty one that needs to be repaired."

I paid for the freezer, was given 2 delivery days. The first on the 7th and then on the 8th. They called me during working hours saying it was a failed delivery because no one answered the door and they called my number and I didnt pick up. Both were lies to get me to £50 for delivery plus £10 VAT. I called and emailed them with evidence that they made no attempt to deliver. They said I will not get the freezer if I dont pay the £60. I eventually paid. They sent an email afterward to confirm whether I will be home or not. I gave them another number to call because I will be at work. In the same response email, I sent a screenshot of the bank transaction and asked for a refund after they said they will pay for delivery. Their response was that I didnot pay for delivery so I will not be refunded. They didnt even call anyone today when they delivered the freezer, they left it the door. If it was raining and it got wet and I have to report a faulty appliance due to water damage, I am sure after reading the reviews they would not replace it.  furthermore,I'm not sure if my home looks like a ware house but I do not have anything to lift the freezer inside. A simple call would have solved this whole issue. a pound on the door even. I am very disappointed in this service. We are replacing our appliances for the season so decided to give the a try and they've definitely lost a customer.

Obviously, delays can happen due to circumstances but they still charge you £10 and they apparently can not track if the delivery was made after the promised time. By the way, I'm aware the drivers are tracked by location and time and they can see where they have been at a specific time. I have asked to speak to a manager a number of times since my two complaints and refund requests. Every time someone else replies without reading previous emails or correspondence. I have received one of the £10 refund as a ""gesture of goodwill"". I have no other choice but to take this matter to trading standards and other regulatory bodies."

With your rules my replacement compressor would have run out of warranty before my main warranty. Sounds like a large company scam to me.

We spent £9.5k on a rational oven, stand with installation. We were told before ordering delivery would be 4/5 weeks and the engineer would contact us for installation.After paying we received emails with expected delivery dates of 4/5 weeks. The expected delivery dates came and went with no updates. I called to ask for updates and was promised a call back with an update, no callback received, so I called again, same response a callback, this cycle went on for some time. During this time I had several calls and emails from the installation team to arrange installation of a product I hadn’t received. After 7 weeks the oven and incorrect stand were delivered, with zero updates or callbacks from Nisbets. After another week of calls and no call backs again, to get the correct stand delivered. I told Nisbets unless they could dispatch the correct stand with email confirmation within three hours I would return the whole order and buy from an another supplier who could deliver in 3 days. Amazing they called back saying the stand would be delivered in 5 days. 5 days later no delivery and a phone call at 5pm from a courier saying delivery would now be 3 days later. Eventually after 9 weeks (not 4/5 weeks) our oven is here and installed, I called Nisbets 17 times (2 hours 25 minutes) regarding all of the above and I received 1 call back, only when I threatened to return everything.I have emailed Nisbets directly to complain about this and what a surprise they haven’t replied!

She said the only way to get my order was for me to do a BACS transfer for the amount and they would refund my card. I couldn't see why this would help with the verification issues - surely if the checks are in place to prevent money laundering then they shouldn't be taking BACS payments instead?

Replacements were sent out and arrived quickly. However there were some items I wanted to return, finally 10 days after submitting via their ‘simple’ returns process form plus sending several emails with zero response, I spoke to someone on the phone who organised a return collection. I took a day off work to stay at home on the agreed collection day, by 4.30 it still hadn’t been collected so I used the chat function and was assured it would be collected by 6.30pm so I stayed in for another two hours, only for no one come to collect the box! The only options given to me now are to take another day off work to wait in for it to be (maybe) collected or get sent a label and have to lug a big, heavy box to the post office - both a massive inconvenience. I was going to place another big order next week, but I’ll be going elsewhere. Nisbets used to be reliable with good customer service, it’s a shame."

As it has only been 6 months since purchase and the appliance is still under warranty I contacted the repair service and shipped it to them.They kept it for 2 weeks and then email me saying ""the unit has been repaired"" (email from the 19th of June from Sarah Hudon).I then asked what was wrong with it and they replied saying they couldn't find any fault.Then I asked why did they keep it for 2 weeks and why did they say that it has been repaired and obviously they didn't have an answer for it as it doesn't make any sense.The assistance they provide is so tragic it would be comic if it wasn't an expensive appliance that stopped working after 6 months and that I can't now use as it still doesn't work. Not to mention that I had to find alternative solutions for the 2 weeks they kept it to ""repair"" it.Avoid at all costs!"

It was from their essentials range and as such significantly cheaper than other manufacturers' products.However it wasn't showing on their website. So I called them and after a little confusion of why it was shown / was it an up-to-date catalogue etc, the lovely lady found 2 in stock in their Birmingham store.I called the store and they actually only had one ex-display model. We arranged to collect it that coming Saturday morning.When we got there it was packaged waiting. When we opened it though, I didn't notice until the Sunday that the drip tray was missing. I called Nisbets and one was sent out. It arrived the next day. So ordered Sunday and delivered Monday.A bain marie we ordered from them died (I may re-review this after we see how they do with the return). Worryingly, the mains cable at the gromit has worn bare so it's also actually quite dangerous.Anyway, and as we were at a festival I needed an immediate replacement so I drove to their Sheffield branch. The guys there couldn't do enough and reminded me that the original was still under warranty so to give them a call.Fast forwards to just this past Saturday and we popped into their Nottingham branch. We only needed a couple of small bit (tongs and a receipt spike). The guys there - Tiff, Charlotte and Lewis couldn't be friendlier or more helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.They even arranged the collection of the original Bain Marie for us (collected yesterday, Tuesday).So my personal experience of Nisbets to date has been nothing but positive.Edit to update: Bain Marie was back with me on the Friday the same week it was collected (I haven't had a chance to test it yet due to other commitments, but incredible service!)"

Had a delivery Thursday morning with eight of the twenty two items missing. No picking note, delivery note, email or anything to explain why. So we call them up and the remaining items are due to be picked and despatched today and delivered tomorrow, Friday. Trouble is royal mail are supposed to be on strike then and Nisbets dont know if we're going to get our delivery or not. Thing is, we were supposed to do the job with all these items today. We can just about put that back until tomorrow afternoon but if we dont get the items the job can't go ahead and then it will be too late. I dont know how difficult it must be to gather items from shelves and put them in a box but this bunch are obviously not up to the task. So guess what, if the items dont arrive tomorrow morning we'll have to go elsewhere and buy them and Nisbets can take the whole lot back and credit us in full, what a joke. We hoped to save time but wont be bothering with this lot again, there are other suppliers who are much better."

After waiting a week it still hadn’t been delivered. Called Nisbets and was told that the order had been made into a quote and not shipped as we do not have a current direct debit for our credit account. Our credit account balance was zero and we paid in full for our order. We did not use the credit facilities as we do not want to. The agent spouted about Terms and Conditions and having an active direct debit on the account…. I am not using the credit facilities so you do not need an active direct debit. I had also emailed them a month earlier saying we were cancelling the direct debit as we had a new bank account. The reply that came back on merely confirmed that we wished to the account by BACS provided the bank details. No where in the email did it provide the requested mandate, or say that the account had to be paid by direct debit. Not withstanding the contemptuous attitude of the agent the who said you had tried to contact us to find out why the direct debit had been cancelled, which is utter nonsense and pure lies. I wish to know what right you have to take a payment, freeze the order - keeping the money, make no contact about the order - all because we don’t have a direct debit in place, despite not owing you anything nor using the credit facilities available. I also require signed evidence of where it states in your Terms & Conditions that a customer must have an active direct debit, even when paying in full for an order, with no balance outstanding. I also want to know why the email I was sent made absolutely no reference to a direct debit being needed even to place orders that are paid for at point of order. A formal complaint was sent, but as expected from this shoddy firm no reply was received, which isn’t surprising given the number of one star reviews they have. Why is it always the customer who has to do the chasing and thinking for the supplier? Nisbets do not value your custom and I would not recommend to anyone to use them.**UPDATE** Nisbets response says that the payment card wasn’t charged which again is completely untrue. The card was charged and money taken on 21/08, and finally refunded on 29/08 after 3 phone calls when emails went unanswered. Bank statements available."

Nisbets first email to me dated 2 March 2023 enclosed quote for “Gas coin operated dryer” (Item 1&1a), with delivery mid-May. We accepted the quote on 6 March 2023 (2) and paid Nisbets £2076 on 9 May 2023.(we tried to pay by credit card on 3 May but Nisbets refused as the card was in my name & not in the name of the Company). On 12 June Nisbets emailed (3) that Coin machine was extra £276, (even though Coin Machine was included in their Quote) this was paid to Nisbets by credit card the same day. On 29 June 2023 a new invoice was received from Nisbets and we replied FAO. Nisbets Sales Director (4).Nisbets replied 30 June 2023 (4a). On 11 July 2023 a letter was sent recorded delivery to the CEO of Nisbets signed by the two Directors (5). The Dryer alone was delivered on 13 July 2023, but without the coin boxes!  On 4 August 2023 a second letter was sent recorded delivery to the CEO of Nisbets together with the reply received from the Head of Customer Operations dated 13 July 2023 (6). Nisbets in the person of their Legal Counsel wrote a reply to the letter dated 4 August 2023 (7), to which no acknowledgement nor reply has been made. The Coin machine package was delivered on 25 August 2023, with parts only. No circuit drawing and no installation instructions enclosed!2.	We are a Private Sheltered Housing retirement complex consisting of 65 separate properties, approximately two thirds are 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, Lounge, Kitchen, dormer bungalows, and one third are maisonettes. Every ground floor property has a patio on which a Conservatory may be built. Every property looks onto a large grass area. There is ample parking space and a Community Room & Launderette consisting of a washing machine and commercial dryer. NO outside laundry drying allowed. 3.	We asked for £5000 compensation is for the inconvenience caused by the unreasonable delay. For the Residents to dry their laundry means taking a taxi to and from the towns Launderette. They are aged between 70 and 100. Nisbets refused & stated that they would use Legal Counsel against us!!4.	I believe any Company has a duty & responsibility to a purchaser from the time of        acceptance until of delivery to the purchaser, certainly within the British Isles, and cannot opt out any legal wording produced by themselves. I believe Nisbets have unfair contract terms that are contrary to Consumer Rights Act 2022 regarding Delivery of goods that “must deliver your goods to you within 30 days of when you place your order” It took Nisbets 128 days for the Dryer & 172 days for the Coin boxes. On 16 September we wrote to Nibets thatNisbets was advised by me that the Coin Box was received on 25 August 2023.It came in a box with NO papers of any sort. No circuit drawing, no installation details.Our installer now has a problem with the Coin Box wire colours. The Dryer is an Electrolux Model  TE 1 220 G. In its Installation booklet for the Coin box it indicates that the RED terminal in the Dryer should receive a wire that came with the Coin box. The wire required in our present Coin box is WHITE!Will you please confirm that what was received by us was the correct Coinbox for this Model Dryer.You will note that the original Coin box was delivered to your warehouse but could NOT be found! So Nisbets had to procure another Coin box.To date we have NOT received a reply!We have submitted a complaint to the Competition & Markets Authority"

And I would like to tell you, don’t make the same mistake as we do.We spent at least £50k for our new restaurant. And I would say, we are always very cooperative and easy to deal with. I almost think they use this against us.We ordered a second combi oven from them 3 months ago. They quoted us the delivery time was three days and asked us to pay for it at the spot. It was over £10k and we said fair enough 3 days is such a good delivery time so we paid for it. We then on the next day, sold our previous combi to make space for the new combi.Guess what? 3 days later we rang them and they said there was a problem and the oven will be delivered in 2 months. They basically lied to us saying it could be delivered in 3 days. But god knows why all the sudden it became 2 months few days after we paid. They said we can put a complaint through but they can do nothing about the delivery time.They compensated us with a convention oven so we can run the kitchen while waiting for the combi oven. We accepted it with no choice cause honestly any oven is better then no oven. We had to change the menu and make adjustments due to the delay.2 months later, the oven arrived. The installation team is of course very extremely busy so they can’t make it but they will be “asap”.So now it has been another 4 weeks. And I still have no combi oven, no patience, no reasonable response, no appropriate compensation for our massive inconvenience.Absolute joke."

I tried to order some products online, when I added one item to my basket it was advertised as 47.99, I also added serval other products when trying to check out the site froze several times, the order finally progressed and when I was about to pay I noticed the total price had increased by over 39.00. I was very tired at this point and needed to be up again in less then 6 hrs to open the business. When I closed for the day I contacted customer services via online chat and have never experienced anything as unprofessional and rude in my life. 3 times I was disconnected from the chat then finally spoke with a Sam well this is where things went terribly wrong, I was more or less called a liar, they rudly said prices are excluding vat, I  explained it wasn't the vat causing the problem, they obviously couldn't be bothered to read the chat and what was said, I got every excuse under the sun including prices change on a daily basis, I pointed out yet again the price changed when attempting to pay and was told I should have put it on a quote and it would be valid for 7 days, I was asked to provide a screen shot as proof, why would I take a screen shot I tried to tell them,  i explained I didn't need a quote and I was a new customer and was happy to buy the items there and then, I also highlighted that the same product despite it been there own brand was available cheaper else where then the new price to be told there was noting they could do. I also stated that they were still advertising the item on Google for the original price, I really should have read the reviews on here before even considering buying from then. I now at the point where I don't have any of the equipment I required on time and just got fobbed off, please avoid this company and use someone that respects there customers and have decent customer service representatives"

I chose nisbets because I assumed being a supplier to the trade I used to work in, they would be supplying quality equipment with a professional b2b attitude. I did not experience this.When the oven arrived there was no box, the polystyrene packing was shattered in areas and there was some visible damage to the oven. I took pictures before unpacking the oven.I contacted nisbets via email initially to the sales email I had received my receipt for the oven from, then hearing nothing back from the sales department I tried the customer service email I was given by the online chat advisor, which later transpired to be the incorrectly spelling, to explain that the oven had arrived with one of the selector switches shattered, a missing foot, and some dents. Eventually I engaged with advisors.Initially I would have been happy if nisbets had sent out a replacement selector and foot, this was not forthcoming.Nisbets ignored me for months, later they claimed I had misspelt the email address, yet it was the address supplied to me by their own advisor on the online chat.Eventually after my condition had worsened, and my food expenses had increased without having an oven (or the ability to easily cook from scratch) nisbets arranged a collection for the damaged goods. The last I heard from nisbets (4th January 2023) was that the oven was being delivered to them by their collection partner (Thistle) and that a refund would be forthcoming. This was not the case, I was issued with a £36 partial refund on 9th January 2023 for a £731.98 oven. I have heard nothing back from them since.I have now had to take legal advice and have had help preparing the Scottish simple procedure to move forward with legal action against this awful company. I am not surprised that they have such a low rating on trust pilot, they have earned it.If you want to avoid stress and disappointment, DONT shop with nisbets, unless you're willing to take legal action, thankfully in Scotland it's only £19 to do so.Update 13/03... Standard holding reply issued, meanwhile.. nisbets are trying to gaslight me into accepting a partial refund because PayPal will charge them fees, this wouldn't be the case if my refund had been issued in a timely manner. This isn't a me problem, I am entitled to my full refund! don't be gaslit by this unprofessional company!"

Their communications between ordering & delivery is 5⭐️ via email, online tracking & website updatesI’ve never been left in the dark about any of my orders / deliveries, and can plan my day as their carrier also sends out an email, confirming the parcel tracking number, an expected drop off time (usually a one hour window), a clickable link to access the most up to date tracking information regarding your parcel from their website, plus any updates you may need to be made aware of - I cannot recommend them highly enough!I’ll certainly keep purchasing from Nisbets while they maintain this level of consistency across great customer service, a quality product range at competitive prices and a delivery network that does ‘deliver’ especially on key items that my business trusts them to get here on the date they promise(Sorry Amazon Business, but you really suck on that benchmark…)So I’ll just keep using the reliable services of Nisbets instead - worth every point on their 5⭐️"

At the end of July we were notified that the item had been delayed a few days before expected delivery. We were then told they could get the same model in a different colour sent out sooner than waiting for our original order which we were happy to accept. We finally received the new keg at the end of August to find that whenever we plugged the unit in, it tripped the power in that room, we had our electrician look at it and he confirmed there is plenty of power available for that units demand. We then reached out to yourselves again and you quickly sent out an engineer. The engineer established the issue and confirmed that unit needs a new compressor as this is what is causing the room to trip. This was carried out on August 9th. You then emailed us on the 12th to say that you would be replacing the unit and ordering the spare part just in case. It is since this day that things have become awful, you will see on my account how many times I have had to call over the last month. There must be at least 10 times over the last month that your staff have told me they would chase it up and get back to me. To this day I have never once received a call back from Nisbets. I have had to chase this day in day out. I have had to speak with True directly because of the lack of response from Nisbets. I have had to make endless calls to eventually get hold of David Lowe who is True’s parts manager. I still to this day have no idea when this spare part is going to arrive. I am told that the item was dispatched Friday but for some reason nobody can find any tracking information for me which in its self is very strange in this day an age. As a customer spending this amount of money there shouldn’t ever be a scenario in which I should be having to do this amount of work just to get our keg working/fixed/replaced. I have Nisbets telling me that the warranty is with True, I have True telling me that the warranty is with Nisbets. I don’t care about the particulars, I shouldn't have to even know about any of that, I as the customer should be put first and any issues with warranty should be disputed between yourselves and True.

She arranged collection for the 6th October. Ref 1142191. Nobody arrived. (She also didn't mention the £80 fee that would be deducted). I also told her that I need the driver to bring a delivery box as the original delivery men took the box and pallet when they took the fridge out the box. (Holly said she would arrange this). Anyway, I then called again and spoke to Georgia the day after or couple days later to return another order. Ref: RMA2394378. Nobody collected the following day.I then called again and spoke to Ben on Monday 9th Oct to ask why this hasn't been collected. He said he doesn't know why. He then told me ref RMA2394378 will be collected on the 10th (and it was - thank goodness). However he told me he would get someone to call me to confirm the ref: 1142191 collection day. I received a phone call on 10th October from a man named Nad which did not explain things clearly. He then informed me of the £80 deduction cost (which was not mentioned to me by any other staff members in the beginning over the phone). I told him that the fridge originally arrived and the delivery men took the box and pallet which was strange. The fridge was too big for our place, and was put into our back storage room with no use. I emailed on the same day of the delivery, and asked if this fridge could be collected. (No email response, so that's when I called Holly on the 6th Oct as mentioned above). You can see it is not easy for me to always make time to call, and to chase up when deliveries are not made properly, or when they are not collected. You are not the only company that I order from for my businesses. Moving forward on Wednesday 11th October, a man called and spoke to my colleague at 8.15am. He was unable to find the place and said he will cancel the collection if he can't find us (we are so easy to find, and when deliveries are made, they seem to find us completely fine! What a coincidence that for a collection, they seem to be struggling). So I attempted to call him back and no answer to my call or messages. The fridge is still sitting here for a long time and it seems that nobody cares or wants to collect this fridge. Can somebody please arrange collection for this item. I am quite concerned as to why this isn't being collected especially as I have notified you right from the beginning as soon as the fridge arrived.I emailed on the 11th Oct to see what happened and WHY the fridge was not collected. Nazmus responded and said he would check and get back to me. It is now Friday 13th and no response as of yet.Avoid ordering items from this company as they do not deal with any issues that occur later on, or if you simply want to return something.UPDATE: They just emailed me after receiving this review, no apology, no acknowledgment at the fact that they took so long, messed around with me for collection. Apparently they will collect today at 12pm. Let's see. I will come back for an update on here. It is so disappointing that I have to leave a trustpilot review in order for somebody to respond. Disgusting.Update on your response: firstly, the item was very ugly looking and bulky hence the return (not that it was too big for the premises). Also, you collected this but with no box! The driver just took it away on a palette. Secondly, I don’t sit behind a screen all day , I email, and simply expect a response. If I don’t get a response, I will chase that company either 2 or 3 weeks after (this doesn’t usually happen with other companies, but with Nisbet it’s hard to get a response back) other bigger companies simply ‘locate’ my email and respond back - something your customer service are unable to do. I can see my email was sent, and the automated response sent, however nobody actually responded on your behalf. Rather than criticise me for taking a ‘few weeks’ to chase after my email (when I finally have time to CHASE you because you were too disorganised to locate the email) you should just take account for your mistakes. I recommend you to apologise to customers instead and take into consideration the wrong actions/ slow replies on your part rather than just try to wriggle your way out."

It is no wonder they are number 1 and used by hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide.","Subject: Complaint regarding Order #26304155Dear Nisbets,I hope this email finds you well.I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent order, number 26304155, placed on September 26th, which was initially estimated to be delivered on October 6th. Unfortunately, the order was delayed by 5 days, causing significant inconvenience and disruption to the church's services.Despite my numerous emails requesting expedited delivery, the order was only delivered on October 11th, and to my dismay, the item arrived faulty and non-functional. Immediately following the receipt of the faulty product, I contacted your customer service department on October 12th requesting a return or replacement. This ongoing delay continues to negatively impact the church's services and operations.Regrettably, the level of customer service I have received thus far has been extremely poor and unhelpful. My repeated attempts to resolve this issue through webchat have been met with assurances that Nisbets is not responsible for the delivery and returns, as an anonymous third-party supplier is accountable. Furthermore, your representatives were unable to provide me with a specific timeframe for resolution, leaving us in limbo.Now, not only have we received a broken oven, but we are also left uncertain about the return process and the possibility of a replacement. It is disheartening to note that your company lacks the necessary information regarding how and when to proceed with the return, leaving us unsure whether we should purchase an alternative oven from a different supplier.In light of these ongoing issues, please be informed of my intended course of action:1. I have meticulously documented all conversations with your customer service representatives and can provide evidence of my attempts to resolve this matter promptly.2. Several individuals at the church can act as witnesses, testifying that the oven received is not functional.3. I have already contacted my bank and lodged a complaint dispute form to seek assistance.4. As per the requirement of the ombudsman, I am officially submitting this complaint to you.Moreover, I kindly request that you consider compensating us for the distress caused by these ongoing problems. Your company's performance and services have had a significantly negative impact on our community, which is highly disheartening.I am hopeful that you will promptly address this matter and offer a satisfactory resolution. Please provide clear instructions for returning the faulty oven and arrangements for a replacement, or else inform us of any alternative steps we should take.I look forward to your prompt response to avoid any further escalation of this issue.Kind regards,Dr. George FahmyUpdate Matt spencer sent me an email and asked me to contact the manufacturer and use the warranty and said they will not return it They don't have any information about consumer act 2015"

It is no wonder they are number 1 and used by hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide.","My interaction with Nisbet Company has left me profoundly dissatisfied. Our decision to acquire a refrigerator for our restaurant from their establishment quickly turned into a nightmarish ordeal. Soon after receiving the appliance, it malfunctioned, leading to an extensive loss of our valuable inventory of perishable goods. This incident dealt a severe blow to our operations and finances, which was deeply concerning, especially considering the pivotal role a refrigerator plays in a restaurant's daily functioning.As a restaurant heavily reliant on the freshness of ingredients, the availability of a functional refrigerator is of paramount importance. The malfunction resulted in the spoilage of numerous products, forcing us to discard valuable inventory that directly impacts our menu offerings and financial bottom line. This loss was not just monetary; it also tarnished our reputation as a reliable dining establishment.What followed was a frustrating engagement with Nisbet's customer support. Our attempts to communicate our urgent predicament were met with unreasonable delays, stretching into weeks. This prolonged lack of responsiveness exacerbated the damage caused by the malfunctioning refrigerator, as our operations were severely hindered without a functioning appliance.After persistent efforts, an engineer was finally dispatched to assess the refrigerator. However, even this process was plagued with further inconvenience. The initial appointment was disregarded entirely, leaving us waiting in vain. When the engineer did eventually arrive, it was after a protracted wait of four hours, during which our operational efficiency suffered considerably.Upon inspection, the engineer delivered the disheartening news that the refrigerator was beyond repair. This revelation, after the protracted period of uncertainty and the cumulative operational losses, was incredibly frustrating to say the least.Adding to the distressing situation was Nisbet's subsequent lack of appropriate follow-up. Despite acknowledging the inherent fault with their product, the company demonstrated a lack of accountability by failing to offer a timely resolution. This has left us in a state of disillusionment and financial strain, as we were not only burdened with a non-functional refrigerator but also with the financial repercussions of the spoiled goods.Considering my experience, I strongly caution against considering Nisbet Company as a viable option for business. Their lack of customer consideration, the subpar handling of product malfunctions, and the absence of effective resolution mechanisms make them an unreliable and unsatisfactory choice. It is my sincere hope that my account will serve as a warning for others who may be contemplating engagement with this establishment.P.S. After 4 weeks our fridge is finally fixed"

Main was good although there was a fry left in my husband's pasta which was a little disappointing. Dessert was okay, I ordered the tiramisu and the whole top part was completely frozen. I just scraped this off and ate the rest but was not too pleased with this. Overall it was an enjoyable dinner with a few minor issues."

The staff were not attentive at all to the point where you have to order anything else you want or need from a QR code. The cheek here is they add 10% service charge, really?

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Leicester Highcross restaurant Have visited many times and never had such poor service as we did today. They sat us right next to the kitchen, the lady that seated us told me due to my allergy of mushrooms I should order a pizza instead of pasta as they can ensure no mushrooms would touch my pizza, and couldn’t guarantee that with a pasta dish, well that irritated me because all the ingredients were in the same area of the kitchen we could see this because we were sat on top of the kitchen essentially, but also I’d told her I’ll just choose something with no mushrooms in it, and having looked at the pizzas there were roughly 15 flavours, and only 2 of them didn’t have mushrooms which was laughable. My husband ordered a mocktail due to driving, tasted like Alka Seltzer, I ordered the pineapple spritz, and received half a glass of nothing that resembled pineapples, not even sure it had spiced rum in it and to be honest I could have ordered a soda water which would have tasted the same but cheaper. The meal came, half the portion I have received previously, the chicken was tough therefore was left. My husbands meal he could have picked up from Marks and Spencer’s and it would have been nicer. The waiter said do you want some Parmesan this is where I expected the cheese block to be grated on our meals, no we got some shop bought pre grated rubbish in a little cup, also we had ordered two pasta dishes so two cups would have been preferable but we received one between us both. No one came to check on us, to say how is your meal, or do you want more drinks, we decided at this point it wasn’t even worth complaining because it was hard enough getting a bill, and we’d have been sat there even longer if we hadn’t noticed you could pay online via the bill, because getting a member of staff to come to you with a card machine was out of the question. Put it this way we will not be going back. It’s a shame it’s gone down hill."

I asked to have a little biscuit next to my coffee which I always have at Camberly Zizzi and love the great almond flavor in the biscuit as it goes so well with my coffee. The waitress said they didn’t serve the coffees with Biscuits at Zizzis. I argued my point by showing the photo of a coffee in their menu with a biscuit. She then argued back saying it was not written in their menu that coffee came with a biscuit. I tried to explain that a little biscuit is like serving the coffee with sugar next to it and it’s not a big deal and doesn’t supposed to go on the menu and I always have my coffee with a biscuit in Zizies. This waitress was constantly arguing with me saying she worked at Zizies for so long and never seen a coffee served with a biscuit. I couldn’t believe that I was arguing with a waitress over a biscuit and I wonder what planet this waitress was from! Thanks to another member of the staff (I believe he was the manager) the conversation was calmed down. This person should definitely be educated about the possible ways of serving a coffee in restaurants!

Tonight we had Chicken milanaese which has changed to cheaper processed chicken, smaller cheaper fried potatoes and they have decided to take all sauce away so very dry. The Salmon risotto was an extremely small portion that should not be allowed to be called Salmon. If the was 0.1% Salmon in this under cooked, pre packaged dish I would be very surprised. The vegetable lasagne was the worst of them all. Once again very small portions that is they are selling as 6 layer vegetable lasagne with a list of delicious vegetables. In reality there are 6 layers of pasta with a tomato sauce with potentially some vegetable mixed in with blender. A 1 course meal with a tip for 4 of us with water was £80 for absolute trash processed, pre bagged food. First thing we did when we got home was to make some more food as still hungry, and we are not big eaters Would have been much nicer and much much cheaper and fulfilling to pop into supermarket and get some ready made meals.

We have been here before with our daughter who loved it (and she very fussy about food). It was our 47th wedding anniversary and we booked a table for 20:00, we arrived early but they had our table ready, they were all very polite and friendly, all the food was excellent can’t give them anything else but a 5 start rating."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Zizzi Bromley I ordered Herb rolled porchetta pork belly with crispy crackling and Roquito hot honey. Served with rainbow heritage carrots, garlic spinach and cubetti diced potatoes, what came was a tiny piece pork belly. Tons of potatoes few bits of chopped carrot, no crackling. Not at all worth £17! I told manageress not happy to pay for it, she said she completely understood, she said I wasn't first to complain. They offered me a different main, but my daughter had hers already so I just had a starter. They gave me this free of charge. Manageress and waitress were so apologetic."

I can't have gluten and first order was a gluten free pizza wasn't great but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and Tonight ordered plain margherita and a new beef ragu pasta dish which I shared with a friend.I know gluten free pasta and pizza isn't great but for £29 I would have thought in this day and age pizza base would be a bit better. Pizza resembled a pretty soggy cheese on very thin toast and the pasta, it's wasn't great. Pre my gluten free days I remember getting beef ragu from Tesco and it tasted better than this. Gluten free or not gluten free for the price it should taste a lot better."

My wife had the ""NEW ⭐ Truffle & Pancetta Carbonara"" she was actually pleased with it being a smaller portion than usual, (being 5ft 0"" and a small eater) but made up for it in taste. Loved it, restaurant has been refurbed since last visit & we will be back. Price is ok, compared with say Dominos its a steal to be served rather than takeaway, would love to see a deal for locals, as we are busy with tourists in the summer months."

Went for my boyfriends birthday lunch just the two of us, came to £70 for one drink each, a starter to share and a main each!! Absolutely outrageous money for such little reward! The loaded fries were soggy and burnt at the same time (how’s this possible??) the garlic bread we got was cold and wasn’t what it said on the menu as it had 2 ingredients which weren’t listed and none of the ones that were! The carbonara was watery and had no flavour whatsoever, the rustica pizza was the only redeeming thing but even then it was so pricy at £16! Drinks were okay apart from my boyfriend’s cocktail had a fly in it the first time and the second one was watery and had no taste. Staff were nonchalant with us and seemed to be just getting through their shift. Would not recommend!!!"

There appeared to be no facilities for anyone with mobility issues: gents toilets ground floor, ladies' upstairs. The ladies only had 2 cubicles, with one of those out of order. The area was tiny, cramped and looked like someone had thrown paint at the walls - it was all very carelessly done. Even the basin had paint over it!

The serving staff were all very good. When it came to paying the bill I tried to pay part of the bill with a gift card. All four serving staff tried numerous times to access it, but with no good result, I eventually paid the bill in full by credit card. Between subtle differences in the food presentation and paying the bill I found the experience disappointing. The next evening the card was taken, on the first occasion it was presented, as part payment of a meal at a local Nando's restaurant.

Also asked another staff member about using Tesco vouchers when I first entered the restaurant, and they said 'just use your vouchers when paying'. Nothing about special menus and exempted items etc etc. Manager point blank refused to accept the vouchers for the 4 meal deals we had ordered, and physically split the order into separate bits (even though the separately ordered items are a larger item), and we had to pay for these items.

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.",Disappointing meal at High Wycombe branch. Paid £66 for a meal which included bruschetta - their idea of bruschetta consisted of two slices of toast with 6 tomatoes cut in half by the side and a teaspoon of pesto - THIS IS NOT bruschetta! I would also advise against ordering the sharing platters - not worth the £16. The staff inturrupted our starters to tell us the mains were ready and asked if we'd finished our starters when it was clear we were still eating. We felt our meal was rushed and uncomfortable. My wife asked for a box for her remaining pizza and the waitress threw the empty box on the table for my wife to pack up her remaining pizza. Not what I would expect of serving staff. Obviously little or no training given to their staff. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!I didn't complain to the manager as I thought it would be pointless and just wanted to leave as soon as possible.Needless to say we willl not be visiting this restaurant again.

I ordered the bruscetta to start and it was literally tomatoes on toast, no onions and no balsamic vinegar. The main was just ok, nothing special. When we wanted another drink, we had to leave our table to find a server, to find them all stood in a corner just talking a laughing.

Simple you would have thought. BUT obviously Zizzi's chef are no longer able to do this. We were told they could not say if it was or wasn't in the dish. This was also confirmed by the manager.

Two mouthfuls, the rest was not consumed. The risotto was the worst I had ever consumed and did not appear or taste as good as the menu described. It was watery, it lacked flavour and the leeks were tough.On receiving the check, the server was very understanding and reimbursed us for one dish, though I think it should have been for the two so called hot dishes.Considering the tables covered at that time of day, about 5, with no pressure on the staff, you would think the quality of all the food would have been at least 99%.I doubt, by the reviews I have read and my experience, that I will attend Zizzi again.Thank you."

Very nearly missed Moulin Rouge which started at 7.30. Several other customers who had ordered food left without eating because it took so long. Staff were polite but nowhere near enough of them.

Buygift voucher was meant to be for a 3 course set menu ended up been £42 in credit for a voucher that cost £50 So dont even get 50 credit like that makes sense. The whole meal cost 65£ total for only 2 courses.  Did not even cover 2 courses for 2 let alone 3. The service was slow at over 2 hours. The food was poor quality. sauce and seasoning bad all round small portions. You can do better elsewhere even at chains for sure.

I called the restaurant, and they didn’t seem to believe me. Their only suggestion was to bring the pizza back to the restaurant for them to check. I did this, and the chef confirmed that it was dairy cheese. They made me a new pizza, but by the time I was actually eating it was over an hour after I initially picked up my order.No refund was offered. I was offered a free drink or free cake but I did not accept these (I already had ordered a cake and was not thirsty).Disappointing."

A very small amount of slightly brown salad leaves, 2 pieces of butternut, 2 small pieces of goats cheese, about a teaspoon of lentils and one strip of courgette. Thank goodness I'd asked for the with chicken option, otherwise I'd have starved. I'd hoped the chicken would be chargrilled but it was the sort of sliced chicken you get in bags in Iceland. And I think they forgot to add the dressing.   the whole ""meal"" was about the size of a side salad, spread out into a big plate. I think it says under 600 calories on the menu, but was probably under 200.  Very very very disappointing for £12.75....plus £2 for the chicken."

My wife had Meatballs Casareccia. The pasta was over cooked and slimy. The meatballs tasteless, certainly no chilli. The whole thing was covered in breadcrumbs to the point that all the sauce was absorbed. No one asked us if our meals were satisfactory. When we went to pay my wife tried to explain why she had been unable to eat her food. We asked for someone senior to attend us. Instead another waitress arrived with the bill which she had discounted by £3.15. I paid and asked for a receipt. She refused to give me a receipt and walked off.

I asked repeatedly and explained that I was really surprised, because I have visited other r branches before where staff have been only too happy to accommodate this request. For a start, to make a mini garlic bread is not a huge diversion from the menu and secondly, surely, it’s cheaper for them to do this in lieu of an actual mini pizza? I spoke to the manager afterwards, an Eastern European lady who also stated that this was not an option. Again, I explained how shocked I was to hear this, given that other branches have always been only too happy to accommodate this simple request, but she was rather rude. At first, it seemed that she thought I was asking for a full sized garlic bread in place of the mini pizza, but eventually she appeared to understand my request and stated “I’ve never been asked for that in 4 years!” Pizza Express is only across the road from Zizzi in Sutton, so I shall be taking my custom there, the next time I’m in the area. Whilst I’m sure some of this may be down to a language barrier with waiting staff, the menu did actually clearly state “if you need to tweak a dish for your bambini, just ask us.” I pointed this out to the manager, only to be met with disdain. Appalling attitude towards customers explains why this branch was particularly quiet."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","We were served by Jake who did not seem bothered if we were there or not? Which was odd as we went at around 4pm & here was no one else there. I has arancini which were very dry & tasted of very little. No choice of dip. Main was belly pork, diced potato, carrots & spinach…..odd combination, but hey ho… pork was cooked nicely, potatoes looked golden but were not crispy and were “floury” inside. Carrots were hard & spinach on the bottom had disappeared. The whole meal needed more moisture or at least the option of some gravy or jus. It’s really poor value but the worst thing was that at no point did the staff ask us how our meal was even though I left half of mine. We had a gift voucher for £30, so only had to pay £23.50 but I left feeling “robbed” at that amount. It was my Birthday, they didn’t know that as no one bothered to ask….as I say be careful what you order."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","I have been visiting Zizzi’s restaurant in Bexleyheath for years. Last week three of us went there on Thursday at 7.30 pm for a long awaited reunion. The restaurant was fairly full the empty tables were covered in used crockery and empty glasses which were not cleared away for sometime. The waiter was quite abrupt and wanted to take our food order but we asked for drinks first. We waited for quite some time when he came over again, asking to take the food order not at all happy when we said we were still waiting for our drinks which had been sitting on the bar for quite sometime. There seemed to be an ongoing issue between the two male staff members. After placing out order the starters came fairly quickly but were not up to usual standard.  Before the starter plates were cleared away the main courses arrived and plates had to be shuffled around. The atmosphere continued between the two waiters and no offer to clear the table of main course plates. We began to feel the restaurant getting colder it was now about 9.30pm no one came back to us for pudding order or coffee. The next time we saw somebody they were wanting us to pay the bill. Sadly, I will not be going there again."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Family took me to Zizzi, Dorchester last Tuesday as a birthday treat.  Was very much looking forward to it as had heard great things.  Service was poor.  Waited a long time for waiter to take drinks order.  One of our group joked it was my birthday and said when we would be getting a free drink - the manager said the water is free - nice!  We then ordered starters - all good.  Then the main meal arrived.  Two out of the four dishes were frozen and the other two were luke warm.  We had to go and grab a waitress who apologised and said they would sort.  The said dishes arrived back in 10 mins when the rest of the group had finished their food scalding hot and with layers of pasta rock hard and inedible.  At no point did the manager come over and apologise for nearly giving us food poisioning.  Sent a lovely young waitress over to take any flack.  She did deliver the news that the mains would not be charged for but at no point did the manager make an appearance - not even to see if I wanted that free birthday drink!  Lovely restaurant, pleasant waitresses, awful Manager and Chef.  Thanks for ruining my birthday Zizzi!  Would also say at no point during the evening did the staff come over to check anything was ok, offer drinks or pepper, cheese, etc - we had to call or go and grab them.  Such a shame as potential to be a lovely restaurant."

She then shouted at us “wait now you’ve only waited 5minutes, I’ll come over in a second” I was incredibly shocked at her tone and the fact she had cleaned at least 5 tables whilst we were waiting, she then continued too clean another table after saying that she would come over, then told me there wasn't at-least 15 items as the fryer was off, we were then waiting too decide if we wanted too say and she snapped “are you coming or going” then sighed and dumped us at a random seat that was seated for 2 (but there was 3 of us), the food was cold and expensive with a long wait time. Honestly I was in shock I have anxiety and this heightened it massively then I was very anxious the whole day the reason I don’t leave the house is because of people like this."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","My friend and I visited the Zizzi in One New Change, London. It was appalling. There were only about three other customers int he restaurant but the place was littered with dirty tables full of debris from other customers - left over food, dirty plates, glasses and cutlery. Despite there being three waitresses in the place they ambled around NOT clearing the tables, instead one was even texting on her 'phone. We watched as they walked past the dirty tables over and over again without even picking up a plate to take to the kitchen! It wouldn't have taken ten minutes to clear them and reset them - it's not even like the place was busy! It took at least 15 minutes for a waitress to come back and take our order and then we waited another 15 minutes for our food - with three customers in the place????By the time the food came out we still hadn't received our soft drinks either which is really not good enough.On seeing my friend's food I knew immediately that it was over cooked and she took one mouthful and knew the fish was off. My food was instead undercooked and the outside of the dish filthy dirty so when I took it off the waitress my hands got covered in the food that should have been INSIDE the dish. The waitress said that she would swap the fish but we decided that we did not want to eat in a restaurant with such blatant disregard  for either appearances, hygiene or indeed it's customers. We will not be back and indeed doubt we will want to visit a Zizzi restaurant again."

We asked to be moved as there was lots of couples placed on tables fit for 4 people, additionally there was 3 other table free that we would of have been happy with but in one of the rude members of staff said we can't be moved as other people have booked ps nobody else turned up in the time we was there. We was also told that there's nothing that can be done about our chair constantly being kick. I complained to staff and she was adamant we wasn't moving tables. We told the waitress we would leave our chairs out from the table as to block anyone kicking the chair as they pass. All of a sudden due to fire and h&s we got moved. The staff are Rude and when I complained I was told to leave she even swore at me.There is very Bad or no management Out of the 4 people we dealt they all had Bad social skills.

Staff spent more time talking to each other, and seemed to have little interest in customer service. The girl serving us seemed new, lacked confidence or common sense. Placed drinks order which took ages, then there was a drink missing.Food: Starter garlic bread with mozzarella & onions, cheese barely there and lots of onion. Kids starter fine. Main: my son and grandson ordered spaghetti carbonara with pancetta and chorizo. Arrived with huge slice of bacon on top and no chorizo in sight. Ravioli few pieces slightly burnt, very overcooked and tasteless. Child’s pizza was ok. Dessert: we were asked if we wanted the bill without ever being asked if we wanted the dessert menu. I had to ask for the child’s fruit bowl. Drinks: after first order where I had to ask for the missing drink, no further visit to the table to ask if we wanted more drinks. I had to ask for the chococino that came with the child’s meal.Facilities: staff using baby changing toilet meant my son had to wait 15 minutes before he could change my granddaughter.Seating: there was a huge area not being used other than by staff. We were seated at a table with 4 uncomfortable chairs next to the kitchen yet there was better seating available. People walking in were being turned away even though there were empty tables.My first ever visit to Zizzi and I can honestly say I won’t ever visit a Zizzi again!!!"

1,Zizzi Ristorante,['Restaurant'],2.2,2022-09-01,Customer,Appalling experience,"Our restaurants are run the Italian way - passionate and homely with a little flair. Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Today a friend and I visited the One New Change  (St Paul’s) branch of Zizzi. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. On entry to the restaurant we saw 2 4 seater tables uncleared from previous meals. They were still uncleared when we left. There were a further 3 tables covered in debris. The restaurant was not busy, only a couple of tables were occupied. We were shown to a table and given menus. Eventually we ordered a main meal each and drinks. During our wait, little attempt was made to clear any of the tables. One of the waitresses made a half hearted attempt to clean some tables and the other waitress commented that she was happy to wipe tables but didn’t want to clear any. One of the waitress was texting on her phone or gossiping to her colleague. Goodness only knows how they’d cope if the restaurant was busy. After a wait,  the food arrived without the drinks. My salmon was over cooked and tasted bad, I believed it to be off. The potatoes were horrible. My friend’s risotto contained undercooked leeks, was a rather small portion and the plate had food smeared under the rim. We complained and the waitresses attempted to deal with it but by this time, the general apathetic attitude of the staff combined with a lack of attention to the customers  and surroundings, left us with no alternative but to leave. Frankly, I didn’t trust the staff to provide us with an edible meal after what we had experienced. This is the first time I have ever left a restaurant without paying. Nothing would have induced me to pay for such incompetence. I have eaten in my local branch of Zizzi and had enjoyable meals. I can only conclude that the staff haven’t been trained properly and the future looks bleak for this branch of Zizzi."

1,Zizzi Ristorante,['Restaurant'],2.2,2023-07-21,Stefano,"Zizzi — Silverburn, Glasgow","Our restaurants are run the Italian way - passionate and homely with a little flair. Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","My sister and I hosted family (father and younger brother) from overseas and wanted to eat at an Italian restaurant. While I suggested Tony Macaroni, my sister suggested Zizzi's because we were shopping at Silverburn. Around 20:00 while still at Flannels, my sister called Zizzi's to book a table for 4 and they offered us a slot at 21:00. We arrived on time and there were only two other tables so we were seated and offered menus. The issues began after we placed our orders. A few minutes after taking our orders, our waitress (name on the receipt states Keira) came back and said that ""actually, we close at 22:00 today."" I asked what she meant by that as it sounded as if they weren't going to proceed with our order when they themselves gave us the table for four at 21:00 when we called ahead. The young waitress was clearly nervous, unsure of herself and stammered that she wasn't sure what to say but had to let us know then she walked away. We gathered that she had been instructed by the shift supervisor to let us know of the closing time and was nervous about the prospect (presumably to galvanize us into eating quickly). Starters were brought to our table and it was immediately obvious that the waitress was serving at breakneck speed as she placed the plates on the table hastily as we scrambled to make space for her before the plate was placed on top of our phones. As we ate our starters she would come back frequently to ask if we were done. In fact, at one point, when my sister — who wasn't done and still had half her starter on her plate — leaned back in her seat for a small break, the waitress said ""finished, yeah..."" and went to grab the plate before my sister stuck an arm out to stop her and inform her that she wasn't done.Mains were more of the same affair: brought to the table and placed hastily down, parmesan sprinkled quickly and she was gone (had to ask for more cheese for my 8-year-old brother). Even before we were done eating my dad suggested we asked for the bill to keep the peace, so we did that and paid before finishing to eat. Once done we immediately left before we were harassed further. I'm sorry to report that for their first time in Scotland it was not a great dining experience and we will certainly not be returning. We're not ones not to leave a tip but it was so hard to find any good points worth tipping on this occasion so we paid the £93.45 on our bill and left. In hindsight, we should have left the moment we were made aware of the closing time as it was a harbinger of bad service to come. I even suggested as much to my family out of fear the food would be undercooked in a rush to get us out the door. Alas, we stayed when we could've spent the near-£100 at a place where the food was worth that price tag for 3 adults and an 8-year-old. Happy for management to confirm my story via CCTV footage from 21 July 2023 between 21:00 and payment timestamp on the receipt of 21:56."

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Hampton Court - Arrived 7.35 and didn't get our food until gone 9pm.  No offer of another round of drinks until we asked.  Excuses of ""we're very busy"" and ""everyone's having to wait"" doesn't help when you're rather hungry on the verge of hangry.  You know when you're going out for a nice family meal and you don't have much lunch to ""save yourself"", well that was us.  The standard response to our enquiry on time was 2 minutes, in Zizzi speak this is 20 minutes.  When it finally did come, my husband's meal was completely forgotten (and came in another ""2 minutes""!), my daughter's side was forgotten - you guessed it, and when it did turn up, the ""large"" fries was no more than a small handful.  My dish arrived with zucchini and it clearly stated cauliflower on the menu.  I cannot stand zucchini and would have no way ordered it.  When questioned, the first waitress disappeared and never came back and it took me an absolute age to catch someone's eye to discuss it.  The new waitress (maybe the manager) picked up the menu and started to study it as if I were lying.  Firstly, don't they know their own menu and secondly, why do that to an already tetchy customer?  I was later told the ingredient list in the kitchen was different, so...?  I was so hungry by that point and everyone else was close to finishing their meals, so I just asked for something quick, like a garlic bread or something.  Yes, you guessed it, another Zizzi 2 minutes - I was ravenous and although family were offering their meals, I chose to wait.  As I got up to tell the waitress to cancel that order as I was simply done, I was told it was literally out of the kitchen - not quite, unless the kitchen is a phenomenally long way from the table.  I sat and nibbled a couple of pieces of shoe leather garlic bread but I was over it by that point.  We were offered a dessert on the house but as my dear old mum said ""we don't want to be here until midnight!"".  They did discount the bill, which saved us an argument but it was such a spoiled event for a family birthday.  Its not even like we were hidden away in a corner, we were right by the door and the pay station - really obvious we were sitting there for almost 2 hours with nothing in front of us."

I also showed the waitress the zillionaires member code as it says too (first time I used it) the waitress went off and then came back and said that I could not have the free starter, no explanation I just could not have it, she said do you want to speak to the manager I said yes.The manager comes over I explain I have a code she takes it and I said that the waitress said I cant have it, no explanation, so off she goes and then comes back and says that the code is not able to be used on a Friday and did I still want the starter I said yes and thanks for letting me know that it could not be used, and tells the waitress that I want the order still.The waitress comes over 5 minutes later and asks again do I still want the starter again yes I still want the starter.The starters arrived after 45minutes, now the restaurant was not busy, and once the starter was finished the mains took ages to arrive also.The food is ok and I like the flavours but the portion size has been reduced and I would not normally be hungry still after going out for a meal, and especially after eating fresh pasta which is filling, but on this occasion I was.The manager came over and I asked for the bill she walked off, I thought to go get the bill as she was by what looked like a till, then she disappeared and we could not see her, then we noticed her doing stuff behind the bar I think she was sorting glasses or stocking the fridge.So, we went to the front counter and eventually she came over and I paid, also it turns out that with the use of the zillionaires club I should have been entitled to a free garlic bread, but I have lost out on that now because should have been given to me on my visit.Overall not the best and I will think long and hard before returning, if I ever do. If I return I will post a new review."

Manager came through and the discussion lasted for a while but we found there wasn't any way to reach the point of understanding - unfortunately even more confusing.We were full of doubts: 1. Waiter kept saying there wasn't any balance left in the gift card          - Did it mean there was £0 balance left in the gift cards? But the bill was just £32.202. Manager telling us they can't give back the balance           - Was she presuming we requesting a new issue of gift card with an updated balance? Of course we not, we do know any gift card balance will be updated automatically and it is unnecessary to issue a new one after each time of consumption3. They insisted not to give back the printout gift cards to us because ""those were in the bin""           - Although the balance can be checked online without having a physical gift card in hand, we don't think it's appropriate to throw away a cash equivalent gift card with unspent value which can be used by anyone          - We can't understand the insistency of refusing to return something belongs to us, even though something might be considered as wasteWe gave up to discuss any more and just asked to get back the threw-away gift cards as well as the receipt of the meal.Later the night, we checked the balance of the gift cards online and found the total value of £35 in the gift cards was used up (That's why the gift cards became waste of the bin) and found the difference of £2.8 was counted as tips which was listed in the bill.It's meaningless to discuss if their service worth this £2.8 tips, it is completely an unauthorised transaction - no one has ever made us aware of this transaction even though there had been a prolonged conversation about the bill and the gift cards.Please Zizzi can you give a response to these?1. Is this a tradition of your restaurant to use up customer's gift card value and count the balance as tips without customers' consent? (Fortunately we haven't bought a £100 worth gift card)2. Is this also a tradition of your restaurant to throw away customers' gift card and refuse to return upon customers' request?

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"The waiter was terribly rude, I visited here on 13th of January at 1pm with my party, and unfortunately, our experience was less than satisfactory. Upon arrival the waiter told us that all tables were booked and left us waiting in the cold for about half an hour.To our surprise, another group arrived without a reservation (we overheard them) during our wait, and the waiter promptly seated them. I went in and confronted him and the other party admitted that they didn't have a reservation and then they left! We felt deceived and frustrated, especially given the presence of a child in our group and the freezing weather.Obviously we also left, and went to one of the other several restaurants in East Dulwich...I really think the management need to review the booking system and the professionalism of their staff as what we experienced this weekend was just awful."

I really wish I had gone somewhere else now.Food was good however, the customer service was appalling. After waiting a long time to be seated, we made our order. For some reason, they served our main course before the starters? When it was pointed out that we wished for starters first, staff seemed startled by this request. How can they get this so wrong? Their own menu even mentions starters as ""pre pizza""? No apology from staff for this.Among others, the starters included Beef Ragu with bread (included). Unfortunately  the bread was not served and we had to ask for it. Things feeling awkward now and once again, no apology from the staff who seemed a bit stumped by us simply asking for what we had ordered.Pizzas came out after a long time waiting. Waiting to pay the bill took far too long as well.Overall, the food was good but the service was appalling. The waiting staff seem disinterested in their jobs and going by the glum look on their faces, probably don't want to work there. It was difficult attracting their attention for the things described above. No one even asked us if everything was OK with our meal.Took my girlfriend there hoping for a nice time and walked out feeling worse. Paid the bill and at least they had the decency not to include the service charge.  Doubt I'll ever go back again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

They investigated and admitted the mistake but said all their procedures were fine as it was the fault of the ticket system! They really don't seem to understand the importance of getting it right when it comes to allergies or contraindications.

Staff very polite and helpful but tables are tiny, not enough room for plates and glasses, let alone dips or oil bottles etc. The huge pizza crust forms about 5cm of the perimeter of the pizza, so only the middle of the pizza has any topping! For us it was far to soggy underneath (I like sourdough but this was stodgy) and the large crust was heavy to consume. The toppings weren't well or evenly constructed and not much flavour either. Sadly a disappointment all round and likely won't be re visiting. After reading the reviews post our experience, I see some people have quoted 'best pizza' in their review??? Maybe other branches are better? We politely informed our waitress of our constructive criticism and she was very polite and professional in her response."

Went to Trafford Centre branch. Order tomato, mozzarella and basil pizza which arrived without the basil. Taste was average. My friends flatbread was dry and had stale rocket on it. When complained about it we got 10% knocked off the bill but this was just the service charge that they add on without your permission. Not sure what service charge they can justify taking, not once did we get asked how the meal was or if we needed anything. Our waiter seemed to be unhygienic which was off-putting from the start.

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I am severely allergic to milk and always order VG cheese in my pizzas. This past Sunday, we ordered some pizzas from our local branch. I was devouring my dinner when I realised something was wrong - there was regular cheese on my food. No dietary restrictions were followed! I decided to talk to the manager and tried to explain the severity of what had just happened and how people could die because of allergies. He could not care less and treated me like I was complaining about a wrong order or cold food. However, the worst part of this interaction came from the establishment's Chef - an establishment run by clowns. He told me, and I am repeating this verbatim: ""I am very happy you are not dead"".PLEASE - AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT ALL COSTS."

Properly neapolitan style (sourdough), usually kind staff, reasonable prices, and generally good music in the background. No wonder they started with 1 restaurant, and now have over 30 in London alone. Only minor reservation: tiramisu' is nothing to write home about. Overall anyway highly recommended :)"

Ordered 5 pizzas and 3 salads between 7 of us. Errors were made in delivering our pizzas to our table.After much conversation with the waitress that we really did not order the pizzas she trying to persuade us to accept, we were given the correct order.After a friend paid the bill, we realised that we were also charged for the incorrect pizzas and an 'optional!' service was added too.We spoke with the manageress asking for a refund of the pizzas we didn't order and didn't eat. She said, ""It's your mistake and you should have checked your bill before you paid!""After much insisting, she said that she couldn't refund any money and that we should write to head office. No apology was given. Sooooo disappointing. Terrible manner from their manager Rachele who said their mistake is our mistake.She eventually filled in a refund form and said she'd send it off.Reading reviews, it seems that others have also been told no refunds are given. We do not have any hope for receiving money 'taken' from us.I suggest that mangers are taught to apologise and try and be kind and helpful rather than switching the blame. Was also rather off-putting to have person making pizzas wearing trousers and underpants falling from bottom, exposed two inches of it! Nice food cannot make up for terrible service! Shall never recommend nor return."

We were there for celebrating my friend birthday . We were a big group with 5 kids and staff was amazing and very friendly. The person who served us diserve 5 stars for the customer service skills. He was frequently checking on us if we were needing anything and updating us about the waiting time for the drinks and pizzas which was very fast. I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 because I brought an ice cream cake and instead of putting it in the freezer they put it in the fridge because they did not have space and it was not in the original condition and almost melted when we had it.

The ingredients were thrown on top into chunks which didnt melt even when I popped it in the oven as recommended. The pizza had far too much N'duja, which was not nicely distributed. The pizza had far too much oil and the mozzarella was dry. This is not the first time I've been disappointed by Franco Manca - often I have had to order extra amounts of basic ingredients (such as tomato sauce& mozzarella) to make it taste as  a good pizza should. I don't think I'll be spending another 15 pounds on a pizza which does not meet basic expectations."

The restaurant was busy but not overly. We sat at the table before presumably the manager ( who whispered and we couldn’t hear what she was saying  ) came to serve us and only because I caught her attention. Well over 45 mins later the food had not  arrived but I guess with only two chefs & a restaurant half full along with outside orders we kind of set the expectation. Lots of serving staff looking like they had no idea what they were doing. More disappointed that we weren’t at least spoken to or acknowledged and that for me is a big fail in customer service .We ended up leaving but not before paying for the two drinks we had and no apology.  We’ve been to the one in Oxford and that was awesome but I won’t be returning I’m afraid.

The burrata was cheap and not runny, the nduja cheap and the dish tasted oddly sweet. The pizza with wild mushrooms, ham and little tomato didn't look appetising and tasted worse than Domino's pizza. Also hated the fact there was no tomato base for it just tomato sauce slammed on top of the really cheap undercooked ingredients. The service was fairly quick although the staff looked exhausted. The atmosphere was nice but the music was way too loud I couldn't talk to my parent well. I am glad the manager told us it was on a house because I wouldn't have honestly paid for such poor quality food that was also rather expensive for what it is worth."

I had mine delivered by ubereats and it was also cold, so I'd obviously been the last of the line with it being delivered on a bike.  I left feedback, but they do not show it and or bother to come back to you, so they will fail as a business, which is sad.

When the food arrived it was cold, lacked any flavour and was quite possibly the worst margarita I have ever eaten which is odd as im not sure how you can mess up a margarita when thats your speciality!

I liked the environment though, the service was good and the staff nice and friendly. The dough is good as always and I enjoyed my n. 2 the next day.  since now, only margherita...."

1,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2022-10-31,Mariana Rusnac,Awful experience and service,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I've been to franco manca in a few locations across London. The Wimbledon one was just a terrible experience, and I won't ever come back. I ordered a pizza with Ricotta,mushrooms and ham. The base wasn't crispy, the cheese was off and made me feel sick after the first slice. I left all the rest of the pizza on the plate and the waitress didn't even asked if everything was ok. Horrible service and experience. I have no idea how this place can work in this manner. Do not recommend there are better places for the same price point."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I usually enjoy  Franco Manca, but this restaurant is not fit for purpose. They need   staff who are not rude ! There were 3 waiters standing around chating to the chefs, ignoring customers, we  waited 30 mins for a drink and well over an hour for a pizza. Even getting the bill took 15-20 minutes after first asking. Please staff the restaurant properly. this restaurant is not fit for purpose, they need to hire better staff !As for the food, it's far too  saltey, and the pizza was burnt  with the tomato  sauce  dried on. The starters are excessively large - the rosemary and sea salt pizza dough is an amount of dough equivalent to a pizza. Again, everything is just far too salty. I like the brand and style that Frano Manca is going for but must admit that in terms of the quality of food, pizza express is much better. This is my second dining experience, and I have to say the food has been of similar low standard on both occasions."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,Bad and slow service. The glasses on the table dirty and disgusting. Had to leave without eating because we just couldn’t wait any longer. 45 minutes just to order drinks. Restaurant was not busy at the time. Have eaten at a different restaurant 4 years ago and the pizzas are very nice. Gone down hill since they have expanded. Real shame!

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,Can’t comment on the food as didn’t get that far as walked into the restaurant and wasn’t even acknowledged. Me and a friend both heavily pregnant were stood waiting to be seated for what seemed like a very long time. No “we’ll be with you in a moment”. We took it upon ourselves to find a table and sit down to then be acknowledged and told we couldn’t sit there as part of the restaurant was closed off due to only two servers working. Was offered another table which was dirty and also not suitable as we both wanted chairs with a back rest opposed to a bench seat. So back to waiting for a table even though I could see there were tables available ready to go. After a bad vibe and first impressions we made the decision to leave as such poor customer service in that first 10mins and appears there are similar reviews re staffs rudeness at this chain. This was Lincoln branch and post lunchtime rush at about 14.30. Word to the wise maybe on a Sunday employ more staff and educate the ones you have on common manners.

Suddenly the rude manager (shaved head and long unhygienic beard) turned up with 2 pizzas and instead of appologising for the delay and issue says "" you want it or not"". Not even an apology for being late and forgetting our order and serving others before us (which could even mean something else...)Terrible place and terrible customer service.

Staff seemed overstretched but our waiter did everything he could to give us a good experience (thank you L).When we had finished I asked if I could give a card tip as I had no cash on me.L told me not to bother because the waiting staff do not get these tips. I had no idea that this was the case and have found out since that only cash tips might get to the staff. This seems very unfair especially as I had previously paid card tips in good faith, expecting them to go to the waiting staff. I don't think many people know this - and probably Franco Manca is not the only restaurant doing this.It all feels a bit dishonest for a brand that sells itself as a zippy, modern company.It will deter me from going again, knowing that the hard-working staff might be being ripped off.Readers: Ask your server what happens to tips and service charges before you pay."

This is an issue in the hospitality sector and it is sad that Mr Nabil Mankarious and his team are not willing to see this and provide help where it matters. Mr M.. you can either bury your head in your latest results (pat on the back!) and assume the next quarter is the same...and lose your business...or you can help your staff to understand the issues and help out. There is a lot YOU can do. Get out of your ivory tower.Your assets...your staff and customers,  without either you have no business.It was my 1st time and last time at Franco Manca.

Back on May 2021 I decide to take my son out for the day, no-holds bard fun fun fun, we went all-over London or at least what we could fit in.  During the day and as always, you will get peckish and in my sons case bloody hungry, he's stomach on legs.  Any how, as it happened, whilst starting to get that desperate feeling as not knowing where to go for lunch, we were standing outside Franco's.  Right place at the right time.  As we approached the door, we were greeted very courteously & professionally, asked to sanitise hands, scan check-in, then we were seated by the window.  We were handed menu's, ordered drinks, told about the specials etc, nothing new, just great service.  The cheerful guy that served us was extremely good at his job, despite giving some tip that might help him in the future, went by the name 'Luciano'.  Honestly no one could ask for better in how someone could look after their customers.  Having struck conversation with Luciano, just made the whole lunch more worthwhile.  Feeling pretty tired going into the restaurant, its amazing how conversation and a giggle can revitalise guests to crack on and have a great afternoon.  So, YES, my son and I will be going back to Franco Manca's, soon hopefully, food was extremely good, service was exceptional, but Luciano, just made the experience that much better.  Mainly its because having been in lock-down for SO long, just great to talk with another human being."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"After going to Franco Manca in London a few times I was excited to hear it was coming to Chichester. I was however very disappointed with my experience (which I really hope is just teething problems being newly open). We waited 45 minutes for a table which is understandable with it being new and exciting. But soon after we were seated we had our drinks order taken - these never arrived until our starters were served 25 minutes later. The starters were very pleasant, no issues at all. When our main courses arrived, our pizzas were very soggy - it looked like a glass of water was poured over it. I tried eating a slice but it made me nauseous and could not eat more. When the waitress came over she apologised but told me it’s how it’s supposed to be when made when with buffalo mozzarella - which I’ve never seen this wet before. The base was undercooked and soaked. I’ve had great experiences in Franco Manca before, it’s just a shame that this experience was very poor. I noticed other tables being left unattended and had conversations with other customers who also never received their drinks. We had 3 different waiting staff attend to us so it was clear no one had delegated sections, and no one was focused on drink orders as it was a bit all over the place.I hope they take all feedback on board and can improve their service and dining experience over all as it is generally a good restaurant chain and I’d like to give benefit of the doubt regarding this experience."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Franco Manca has always been a to-go-to place for pizza cravings around London, and we had exactly that on Sunday 15th Aug after visiting V&A next door.The restaurant was nowhere near full, but we were pointed to a mini table near the kitchen and given a judgemental look when suggesting a 4-seater (many of which were available). We are both 6ft tall and leg space is always appreciated, but of course we would move if larger parties were to come in afterwards. Noone expects a 5* service (just a delicious pizza served with a smile, thank you!), but interactions with the staff were rather unpleasant - it felt like the place was run by teenage girls with no supervision or customer service training. The order arrived quickly, but no-one checked on us throughout dinner and eye contact attempts were proficiently ignored. We ran out of water and could not order anything else as the waitress simply brushed by the table collecting empty glasses/bottle without asking if refill is needed. The bill arrived incorrect and instead of explaining the error proactively, the girl waited for it to be questioned - again, no customer service skills whatsoever (where a simple sincere apology would have done the trick). We paid and left without placing any complaints as this would have been simply pointless and would make the experience even more bitter.All in all - although hospitality is going through a rough time - please train your staff better, service is still about quality not quantity. A smile, as such, costs nothing - even post-pandemic!"

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,My fiance and I used to visit regularly before lockdowns and the service and food used to be great. We went to visit again once restaurants re opened and the service and quality of food and portions is terrible. 1) We first ordered a side of olives and only got 5 pieces in the little bowl. Usually the fill the bowl up. 2) We then ordered a side of mozzarella and garlic bread (which is the same price as the pizza) and we barely had any mozzarella on the bread. It was also luke warm when it arrived to the table and not hot like their pizzas and food usually is. 3) the two waitresses were just lazy and looked like they didn't even want to be there or do their job. 4) pizzas arrived luke warm and not straight away from the oven like they normally used to do. And it wasn't even the right order after making us wait 15+ minutes for food. Will not be visiting this branch again. Service and quality has gone down the drain massively. There's no excuse for food to come out warm instead of fresh!

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Hello, I have visited Franco Manco restaurant in South Kensington with my mum on the 22nd July 2023 around 5pm. We had a pizza with a tiramisu and drinks. I don’t always look at the bill but I’m glad I did as they charged us 2 extra items which counted for 30% of the bill value. When I told the staff member, there was no apology and we were told that we have to fill in a form for a refund as this is the policy and then wait up to 5 days for the money to be refunded. My mum was not happy as this has never happened, money is normally refunded straight to the card, especially when this was not our fault - they put random items (extra ice cream and tiramisu) on our bill. When we filled in the form, I asked if there in any proof they can provide and the member of staff just smiled at me that this is a billion dollar company and they refund every customer. I believe this was a manger as the lady was dressed differently; not in uniform, with dark hair. It was not the person who asked for our order. Until today - 3rd of August, the refund was not received. I am very disappointed with the service and basically being robbed. Thanks a was a visit of my mum in London and we never came across situation like this in a restaurant. I have also emailed Franco Manco via their website and have not received any response. I would like to know how I can received this money back and how is this possible to happen in a big chain like this. This is only £10 pounds but as I mentioned it is 30% of the bill, the service provided was horrible, and we have never been refunded. My mum is not from London so she has no way even going back to the restaurant, it is additional time and money and it has been inconvenient enough to deal with this situation. Very disappointing!Unfortunately I don’t see the option to upload attachments to upload the receipts."

1,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2023-10-24,Chris Welsh,Very sad to see another poor customer service experience. Why,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"We discovered Franco Manca in august, Southampton branch. It was the only restaurant with a table in the area and it wasn’t too bad. We thought the sourdough pizza was a bit chewing good texture and red wine in a tumbler? The menu is only pizza and some odd topping choices but hey Ho we were hungry. So when we recently were in london, the Aldwych branch popped up as a pre theatre option and we figured okay let’s go! We booked a table for 5:30 and arrived bang on time. On arrival the guy who checked us in frankly couldn’t really be bothered. They were clearly busy, but there is no need to make your ‘guests’ feel like they don’t want you to be there. There was no table, He said can you sit over there at the bar. In any other restaurant I have ever been to this means we will hold you here until a table is free but no, the bar here is four seats next to each other to eat. Not an ideal family meal out. Families came in after us and we’re show to a table of four. So what is the point of booking a table? We were given no choice but we English don’t want to kick up a fuss and nor do I want to do so on a family night out with our young Son. The food was poor all the toppings were literally thrown into the middle of the pizza so most of the pizza is just dough and a bit of cheese at best. Wine in a tumbler. Rustic some might say. Okay but just no better than a cheap takeaway in the street. When we came to pay they had added a service charge said optional and make no mistake I always reward good service but the guy who we met and who did most of the servicing was poor communication and just did not gel with his customers so I asked for the service charge to be removed. They then all went into a huddle and giving us the eye making us feel uncomfortable. He asked why and I told him why and he said we are having a very busy night. Sorry but that’s no excuse for not caring and making customers feel like they have had a service. If your not in a rush and just want a cafe pizza indoors but no engagement from the staff and happy without a restaurant experience but pay restaurant prices then okay but we won’t be going again. Looking at overall reviews another soon to be victim of nice try but failed. You’d think a company of this size would listen to its customers and get the staff and n basic customer service courses. With a 2.7 rating something can be done about it as statistically over time this has slowly been dropping."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I popped into the Richmond branch at around 5pm on Thursday 30th September to discuss holding my 3-year old's birthday party in the basement. I took a table until a member of staff was available to show me the event hire area. I went to fetch a high chair for my 11-month-old who was in her pushchair. As I crossed the room my baby started crying. A woman customer sitting with a man at a table nearby asked to be moved and gave me a dirty look which made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Seeing the staff were busy and now feeling unable to relax, I decided to leave and return another time. The waitress helped me to the door and then as I was leaving the woman customer with absolutely no provocation whatsoever stuck her middle finger up at me. The waitress also witnessed this vile and rude gesture. I was extremely upset, flabbergasted and at a complete loss to understand what had just happened. I responded to the woman that she had no right to treat me like that especially as I was leaving the premises because she had made me so uncomfortable. At this point, the woman customer leapt from her seat and began to scream at me in an aggressive and frightening manner. At this point I was completely overwhelmed and felt faint. The young waitress helped me to the ground and I was shaking. The woman continued to scream at me. It was clear she had completely lost all self-control. The woman’s behaviour was totally disproportionate to the small amount of noise my children had made. I felt frightened and intimidated at this outburst. To make matters worse my three-year-old started crying because she too was frightened and upset I had collapsed. She couldn’t understand why this woman was screaming at us. This was a very upsetting incident for my children to witness. The female staff member (who I think was called Danielle) was incredibly kind and was obviously shocked herself. She soothed the children and gave us apple juice. She offered for us to stay and was very clear we had every right to be there, which of course we did. However, I did not feel safe with this woman in the same restaurant and didn’t want my children around someone who had such a short temper and whose behaviour was clearly unpredictable.My complaint is that whilst the young staff member was extremely kind and caring, a senior member of staff should have stepped in to deal with this. To allow a customer to use what is probably the most aggressive and offensive gesture towards me -  completely unprovoked - in what I thought was a family-friendly restaurant with no repercussions or consequences is totally unacceptable and outrageous. I no longer feel that Franco Manca is a safe environment for women, girls or young children.I emailed a complaint to the management of Franco Manca and received a woefully inadequate response which did not deal with the intimidation or the offensive gesture used. It was purely perfunctory. So be clear, Franco Manca allows its customers to be verbally abused, bullied and intimidated and the perpetrator is welcome to stay at the restaurant and the victim needs to leave to feel safe. Management conceded in their email that they had no official policy to deal with such incidents which I found staggering.  Of course the venue now will not be used for my daughter's birthday party, nor we will ever visit any branch of Franco Manca again. It's clearly not a safe family environment. Shame on you, Franco Manca."

The eVoucher has some prominent information like: the amount, voucher number, and his message to me. Further, it had longish instructions on how to redeem it and I didn’t read carefully until now when I planned to use it for a family dinner. Upon calling customer service, I was informed of a 9 months expiration date policy, which upon closer read, I found buried in the terms and conditions fine print. While I do understand that this company has “covered themselves” with this fine print, it feels very sneaky and greedy. I clearly had no idea of the exp date. It wasn’t prominently displayed. And now, a very generous gift from my boss has gone to waste and to this company’s bottom line.  I will make sure my boss is aware and never uses their services!!"

When I got through by phone today (on the third try, having left messages before), they said they would not be willing to book a restaurant tonight because (1) of their 48-hour policy and (2) everyone but the person on the phone was on annual leave and she was busy answering phones. Hard to see how they add any value if they require 2-days notice to book anything --assuming you can get through to them and they have enough staff. One can guess that GG makes money, in part, by sitting on the cash paid in to buy vouchers which have not yet been spent. When one books a restaurant which does not take their vouchers directly, GG calls the restaurant and gives them a credit card number (as the restaurant in question explained to me)--presumably GG's own credit card number. Thus, one is entirely at the mercy of GG to make one's restaurant booking for one in a timely way. A great business model -- this is how the traveller's checques of old used to work-- but hard to see how this is anything other than an unnecessary and unwelcome encumbrance on the user."

A couple of weeks ago I booked my restaurant through GG, all went through okay on their site. I was concerned when I didn't receive a confirmation of booking email so I emailed GG. No reply. Then I called them. No reply. I emailed again. I called again. Still no reply. So I went to the restaurant and they had no record of my booking and they also told me the date I had booked was no good because they were actually closed, so the diary on GG is incorrect too. So I have a £100 voucher that I cannot use. Seems it's 5 stars if you receive a voucher - using it is quite another matter."

Booking fee.Then they don,t even provide you with a nice looking voucher just a code and difficult instruction.Once you are ready they need 24hours notice.And worst if you don’t spend the whole amount they steal the rest of you.Edit after reply from Gourmet Guide.Direct quote from the email they sent.“If the cost of the meal and drinks is less than the value of the Gourmet Guide Resaurant GIft Voucher no change or cash is given”So I am right they do steal any money you don’t use.  Maybe the person who replies here should actually read their own terms and conditions.  Or are they willing to offer me a full refund including my fee for being wrong.  My bet is they will not!"

And they put it buried in the smallprint KNOWING it catches people out. Tried to make a booking and was told voucher expired... Thats £50 in cash out of my kind friends account straight to the coffers of the Gourmet Guide. Beware if giving as a gift. Tell the recipient of the validity or perhaps make a better choice and go with another company - there are plenty out there."

This is such a nice idea but I hope no-one ever gets me these vouchers ever again as they're so complicated to use and the website is so rubbish it's almost unusable. The fact you can't see restaurants on a map is crazy in 2022 - just because two restaurants are numerically the same distance away, doesn't mean they're equally easy to reach! You also can't book online for less than 2 days in advance - the person on the phone was really helpful and got it sorted but it took more time than it should have. The fact you have to go through this weird pre-booking process in the first place is also such a blocker to using these vouchers again. It also wasn't clear when we first received the vouchers that you had to do this - the website is so rubbish that we couldn't actually find that information - so the first time we tried to use them we could not and ended up paying more for a meal that we wouldn't have bought otherwise. I've given GG 2 stars because in the end, customer service were really helpful, but it would have been 1 based on the website and booking experience."

No opening times of this phone line were provided with the voucher (they are only available in office hours and Saturday till 5:30pm) and you can't redeem the voucher directly in the restaurant. You have to book the restaurant through this phone line. That was aleeady very inconvenient!2) I called Sat 06/08/21 4:30 pm and I had to call 12 times before I got someone picking up the phone and with a few times were the operator cut off the line while it was ringing. It was obvious someone was there, but they had no interest in answering the phone. The operator told me she was on a break (who is taking a break one hour before they finish work). 3) The operator told me I could not book this particular restaurant, because she knows the restaurant and supposingly it is always fully booked on a Sunday, which was not true as I could make a booking myself, which I did. She also told me that for this restaurant she has to buy the voucher from the restaurant itself and she couldn't buy it because the restaurant website was down. While I acknowledge that the main page had an issue, all sub pages were working.4)  the operator told me she would be on a break again till 5pm! Either gourmet guide is quite generous with their work breaks or this women was making her own working hours. Also the opening times of the phone line doesn't include any breaks!! I called at 5pm, but the answering machine did not take me anymore to the operator. She must have changed that (the length that people go through to not do their work is incredible!!). I did manage to call a number she previously called me from to say that this restaurant is fully booked (which was not true) and finally got her to redeem the voucher. The whole process took almost an hour!! All in all a very inconvenient and very unprofessional service. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy a voucher from this gourmet guide!"

He was friendly and courteous and explained that I received the original message due to an internal error. He managed to resolve the situation quickly and turn a negative experience into a positive one. Original message below (1 star review): Gourmet Guide has responded to several reviews on this site saying that it is rare for them to enforce expiry date rules. This is disingenuous, as I contacted them today regarding vouchers that we didn't realise were expired and was told that the system cannot redeem expired vouchers.  We were given vouchers as a wedding gift last September, and had planned on using them to celebrate our anniversary. When we got the vouchers out to book, we realised they expired within nine months. After reading Gourmet Guide's responses on this website (for example, GG's response on 24/06/2019 - ""In reality it is very rare for us to enforce the expiry date rules and expired vouchers are honoured 99% of the time""), I contacted them (enquiries @gourmetguide.co.uk) to see if it would be possible to honour the voucher. The reply that I received was as follows: ""Hi,Thank you for your email.Our Vouchers do expire after 9 months, so unfortunately there is no way of redeeming these at this date.If they were still in date we could extend for an additional charge, but with them being fully expired our system wont allow us to redeem now.Sorry again.Kind Regards""So either the claim that vouchers are honoured 99% of the time is false, or these are the 1% of vouchers that are not honoured (with no explanation why ours will not be and the other 99% would be).Really displeased with this interaction and the misleading information that has been given in response to bad reviews. I understand if it's not possible to redeem the expired vouchers, but they should not indicate that they will be honoured if this is not the case."

We chose the Red Lion in Cricklade. The communication from GG was excellent. They confirmed the booking and told us we weren’t to worry about taking the voucher as it wasn’t necessary, the pub was expecting us. I then got another email wishing us a lovely evening on the Friday prior to the booking.  On arrival to the venue we were a little dubious as always when using a voucher, but true to the confirmation received from GG, the booking had been received and our table was waiting for us. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed the experience very much. I even texted my daughter To say we had found a lovely place and that they should try it. The embarrassment started when the bill came and the price was for the full amount £83. I told her that we had booked through GG and that we had redeemed a £50 voucher when making the reservation through GG.  She then said she would check with her boss, then came back to the table and asked for the voucher or some kind of proof. GG said I would not need the voucher!!! So embarrassing! She then went off with the voucher. 5 minutes later the Maitre came over to say that they didn’t accept vouchers and that we were fortunate as the voucher was valid until the end of the year so we could use it somewhere else! Mortified by now, we refused and showed him the 2 emails from GG. He then shot off and we saw him speaking on the phone. Perhaps to his superior. He then came over and started to backtrack and apologise because his superior hadn’t told him or any of the staff about GG. He then asked if we had enjoyed our meal and proceeded to charge us £33. The whole final experience spoiled the night. We felt stupid and cheap, we decided last minute not to leave the £10 tip which we thought the staff deserved for the simple reason that we were embarrassed. Lack of communication from management to staff ruined our lovely evening. So our advice to voucher redeemers is be cautious. We later wondered if we should have mentioned it on arrival but GG said there was no need to even show the voucher, that the venue would be aware. If we had mentioned it, we would have probably not been shown to our table as the Maitre had no idea whatsoever. Unbelievable!  Finally, these vouchers are issued to people with good intention but sometimes they are a pain in the butt. Great meal but awfully embarrassing."

These solutions enable restaurants to connect better with new and existing customers and to simplify & boost your daily business.","Absolute sham of a business. I signed up in 2017 and asked for a lag time of 24hr for bookings. This was repeatedly changed (especially at busy times like Christmas) meaning bookings would be made 5 min before they arrived. I had no control and was charged for every booking, they also hijacked my google ads and would not remove it after I left them.When I cancelled my contract, 2 reps confirmed a leaving date yet I was told by accounts I could not leave for a further 10 months.When I complained and asked for compensation for all the bookings that came in outside of my agreed lag time, the rep said it was something Quandoo did a lot without asking the user first. 1year I chased for an anwer to my complaints regarding the breach of my contract. Nothing.Nearly 4 years after, I recieve an email again threatening legal action for costs they enforced on me and sent my original signed contract with a fraudulant addition copy of their 'terms and conditions' that I had never seen before stating that they can change terms of agreement at any time and give the user a 6 week period to confirm or disagree. Never had these terms when I signed plus never had any correspondance off them at any point when my time lag was changed. They now have the audacity to chase me when THEY breached my contract. They also breached the contact with multiple misrepresentation from their staff. A diabolical company with the worse standards. DO NOT USE if youre a small business owner."

I'm betting if I hadn't double checked the first I'd known about the cancellation would have been when I turned up for my meal.

I redeemed my points for cashback and was fine initially. Then they asked me recently after a couple of months unrelated to the points I waa redeeming to provide proof of the reservation attendance before they pay me cashback. Well I don't keep a receipt for drinks and food that I buy for a couple of months and I paid by cash so I don't have proof other than the restaurant confirming the booking and attendance as its asks for a review. They basically said to me if you can't provide proof by either a receipt or bank statement they will close my account and cancel all payments. The confirmation of reservation wasn't sufficient proof?Bit of a scam and joke of a company as they pay after 14 working days and forget to pay so when you request the 14 working days starts all over again? Would not recommend.

Alas, after 2 & 1/2 months they changed it and have refused to remove it.  The reason why we wanted to move away from Quandoo is because they have still to this day refused to put in our cut-off reservation times.  Meaning a customers can simply book a table 5 minutes before arrival and get a confirmed booking even though the restaurant is fully booked !!!We pay Google to promote our venue and Quandoo steals them from us.  They need to concentrate on building their own following and not adding their reservation link to our Business page.  Why Google allows this to happen I have no idea."

At the time I tried to find a nearby restaurant to use them in but all the ones listed on the app turned out to be no longer part of the scheme. My mother was terminally ill at the time and on 28th June I contacted Quandoo to tell them that I would struggle to be able to redeem my points because of the lack of outlets to use them in and the fact my family and I were spending most of our time at my mum’s bedside and asking if I would be able to receive an extension of the deadline under the circumstances. I received a reply on 30th June from Quandoo to say they have reached out to the appropriate department and they would be in touch. I heard nothing more and sent them a follow up email on 7th July asking them if they had any updates and also informing them that my mother had subsequently passed away.

WOW!!! We had so many guests calling us, because they received an email saying their table had been cancelled!!! In shock we phoned the support line asking what had happened and they told us that the headquarters in Berlin had by mistake put us in Tier 3 and without any correspondence just cancelled all our bookings. By the way, we are in Tier 2,just to set the record straight.I then tried to contact our area manager via WhatsApp and was blatantly ignored, followed by 'you should call the support team, I am not support'!!! WOW!! What a company this is!!??? I rang Berlin (I was brought up in Germany) to then been told that it was the UK head quarter that was at fault!!After the bookings were put back on our system, I asked our area manager Lisa to quickly send out an email to our guests to explain that their table had not been Cancelled and she said that they would do it tomorrow. OMG!!!Tonight we had two tables not showing up!Of course we rang our guests, but we could not reach all. The owner of our business did not receive any correspondence from Quandoo, no apology NOTHING !!!We are fighting through these very hard times and Quandoo choose to ignore this fatal mistake to our business!! DO NOT SIGN UP TO THIS COMPANY EVER!!"

He clearly went over the essentials of safely handling a firearm and appropriate PPE, and even as complete novice guns (this was the first time either of us shot a shotgun) we were soon hitting the targets. He selected a smaller 20 gauge shotgun and less powerful shotgun shells to ensure my wife wasn't going to be too sore or thrown around, which we both appreciated.Clear and simple advice on how to best handle the gun, position your body and aim for each target was given, and immediate feedback on what you were doing wrong was incredibly helpful.The range of different targets presented was impressive, giving us a good idea of what clay pigeon shooting was about.Between the various targets, John kept up an interesting conversation on various aspects of shooting, which was enjoyable.A great day out, and once my wife's muscles recover from holding something that heavy, I imagine we'll be back!"

The instructors know their business inside and out, their tips were demonstrably accurate with no hint of impatience of condescension despite us being first-timers.
We packed a lot in during the two hours, clay pigeons, archery, air rifles and it was clear that the instructors wanted us to get as much out of it as possible, rather than seeing us as just 'another group' to get through.
 Definite thumbs up from me and my companions."

The restaurant wasn't overly busy but we had to wait over thirty five minutes for our main course, which was a very ordinary cooked steak. The two waitresses were rushing around like crazy and were apparently short staffed by one. The real problem seemed to be in the kitchen where the lone chef just couldn't cope. The food quality was rather mediocre as well. Despite the very attentive and hard working waitresses we will not be going back anytime soon. The head waitress deserves five out of five stars for her hard working performance though!"

We had a lovely flat white coffee while we waited for our main course ‘Poulet Breton’ which sounded delicious from the menu description. The reality was very different. We both agreed that it was the most bland and tasteless meal we could remember. The ‘sauce’ was a thin grey liquid totally devoid of any distinguishable flavour, and the vegetables apart from the carrots which were slightly hard a mushy mess. I have eaten proper French bistro food in France many times and it was always delicious. This just wasn’t. We ended up wishing we’d just gone to McDonalds and paying a quarter of the price for a tasty meal.We used Tesco club card vouchers for this visit but won’t be returning."

We also have occasionally dined at Tenterden (now permanently closed) and other branches also now closed. Any hint of the old favourites (reduced in portion size over and over again) has disappeared and all that is left to accompany the familiar comfy seats are overpriced items. Despite cost pressures there are several nearby restaurants that provide good value.

Everything came out on 2 flare plates not nice afternoon tea stands and then we were charged for refills of drinks which were included in the package.

Had to order food on the app, a group of 5 elderly ladies took time, couldn't find drinks required on app so asked a waitress for assistance, she said she wasn't really allowed to do it, but took pity on us.  The food was expensive and chicken was almost burnt. Worst meal we've ever had. The sting in the tail was the £15 service charge !  Needless to say it wasn't paid.

I WISH that I had gone with my original idea and booked The Ivy in town. This place was a dump, with all the ambience of a GPs waiting room. The food was extremely ordinary and of the two 'waiters' staffing the place, one in particular appeared to have wandered in off the street (no uniform or apron!) I watched one customer enquiring about the fate of his order only to be met with unguarded disdain. There is something very unappetising about watching a waiter continually touching their face and hair.....ugh!  Finally we waited SO long to be asked if we would like a dessert that we gave up! We worked out that lunch at The Ivy would cost about the same. Dont go here, spend your hard earned cash somewhere else, trust me!!"

Absolute timewasters. Left the restaurant disappointed, shocked and hungry. Asked if we could have our drinks free for the mistake, the waitress said no and blamed the chefs.

First the prawns were completely tasteless and crunchy overcooked and unpleasant. The so called sour dough garlic bread was a very cheap tasting shop bought pizza base very hard and dry with a small amount of cheese and was inedible. For our main meal we had beef bourguignon the sauce was pleasant but was mainly fat and gristle for £16.95 way too overpriced for below parr food needless to say we will never return foor was quite frankly terrible.

Used a voucher so menu was limited but well sufficent. Well cooked and well served. Greeted nicely at door and the rest of the experienced matched that. A little friendly chat before we left was just right. Made to feel as if a customer is appreciated and would want to come back. If our experienced had been videod for training purposes I would be happy. My only complaint to them was their location was too far from my home to be regular. Rouge have closed too many but hopefully will build up again.I have read the bad reviews and I hope the management take note and ensure our experience should be the standard.

It's the worst thing I've ever tasted. Presentation and hygiene was poor. The teacup were dirty, which had to be replaced twice. The sandwiches hardly had any fillings in them. Comparing to what was advertised on their website it definitely was not what was presented to us. This whole saga just spoilt the whole mothers day experience. Don't waste your money on the afternoon tea. The bread was old and stale. Which was just cut up baguettes with leafs in them.Upon poor and slow service the end result of the food was just a waste of time."

My main concern is the service is often slow and erratic, the new staff not so friendly and always seem grumpy. The new steak menu is not as good as the old one, and more expensive. The deserts are also a bit disappointing now, the crème Brule is always cold, and the hot melted fudge is always hard and cold. Standards have definitely slipped which is a really pity."

I mean I know baked beans have gone up in price but charging £1.50 for what amounts to a fifth of a can is absurd. Won’t be going there again.

Despite one large party, there were only a handful of other tables, yet drinks were being prepared and left on the bar for ages before being taken out, dirty, vacant tables were not being cleared and food service was slow.When we did finally receive our food – (2 x 5 minute steaks and a steak baguette) it was completely cold. The garlic butter ontop of the steaks had half melted and conjealed, the chips were luke warm and the meat pale looking and cold – totally unappealing. Costing £45 for these 3 dishes along, we were not prepared to pay for such sub standard food. We raised our dissatisfaction and were given the suggestion to take it away and ‘try again’ at which point we said this was unacceptable. The manager then came and without much discussion or apology, (other than to disagree with my suggestion that it must have been left sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out) removed the food, removed the cost as a ‘manager’s discount’ Leaving us with a bill for our (over priced drinks and starter).Based on this experience, and the competition in the area, as well as the reduction on disposable income I feel its unlikely we will ever come back to a Cafe Rouge again."

The breakfasts were luke warm and my breakfast had a blonde/grey hair in it. After telling the waitress/manager about this apologised and offered me another meal but like I said by the time it would arrive everyone else would be ready to leave. When the bill arrived my meal & extras were still on the bill and we were told they couldn’t take it off as the system wouldn’t let them but they have a slight discount.What a load of rubbish. Rubbish food and rubbish service. When we asked for the service charge to be removed we didn’t even get a ‘thank you’, ‘enjoy your day’, or even a acknowledgement. We have dined out every morning and evening and really enjoyed every meal and the service has been outstanding BUT CAFE ROUGE LETS CENTER PARKS DOWN!"

Two of our party had unset stomachs the next day. both the waitresses that served us were completely unconcerned that the food was cold or that the service was so poor. We complained to the manager and he took some money of the bill, but that is not what we wanted we just looked forward to having an enjoyable meal together. would not go there again"

Pictures on the wall were really good but then came the food which I would even give to my dog. I ordered the salmon and was obviously frozen and smelt awful. The potatoes along were cooked together with the fish which smelt terrible. My partner had the poulet breton, the chicken was hard over cooked and tasteless. The crème brûlée could you get it in a smaller pot. One spoon and it was gone. Overpriced and the food was terrible. We would never return. I would recommend others never to go. It’s a shame that the bosses at Cafe Rouge don’t have the intelligence of understanding the restaurant’s business. It would not take long until Cafe Rouge collapse and disappear."

Went in for a meal and a drink in the evening. Although it was quite busy so patiently waited for 15 mins for a table. However, even when some people left and there were empty tables, was not offered a table for another 15 mins and ignored by the staff. Then had to go to the reception and yell at him about the staff behaviour and he apologised and immediately allocated a table. Then the staff came and apologised. Staff asked if I was ordering meal using any voucher code behaving as if customers can not afford their food and asked for any voucher codes to be used for payment. Overall although food is good, staff and service needs a lot of improvement. If you don’t treat your customers well, they will not come back again."

We sat there for a while before been given menu,s, then another 10 minutes before been asked for drinks order, our waitress had a very sour miserable face! We eventually place our order. We had mushrooms on sour dough toast to start, they were cold, sent them back, second set was tepid when it arrived, only ate it because we were very hungry! We had been in the resturant nearly an hour by this point! The starter was taken off the bill and we were given two sets of complimentary drinks! Our main course was lovely! All in all the service is very slow and our waitress looked very put out! Don,t go if you are short on time! Very disappointed as we love coming here!"

Waited to be sat at a table without correct no of placings. No Menu offered. Ignored until we asked. No request to order drinks - again until we asked. Diner order came out incorrect. Could not be bothered to get changed. Other tables had much more attentive service. If we'd had not had vouchers for 50% off, would have left without eating. Food OK, but nothing special. Left waiting for dessert menu. 2 x coffees turned up, only ordered x 1. When requested  service charge to be removed, done so without a fuss. Good. But why no curiosity as to why?.Would not recommend this restaurant. It was not busy, others had better service. Think people need to understand. We have a choice. Bad service = lost business. Lost business leads to no business. No business leads to closed. Closed leads to unemployed. Managers, THINK and train your staff. Look at your reviews, your stats. How many people get a comp bill, how many times is the removal of the service charge requested. It tells you about how badly you are running your restaurant. Please listen, and most of all, act before its too late"

2,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-04-16,Teresa Bailey,Brighton Marina restaurant,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","Brighton Marina restaurant.  Both my starter and main course came out 'warm' as opposed to hot so I had to send both of them back.  Although they apologised they didn't even offer a small reduction on the bill just as a gesture of goodwill, as I ended up eating my courses at different times to my family.  To me this would have shown good customer service and an acknowledgement that it was not really acceptable for it to happen twice. Waiting times were quite long, although there were other customers it was mid afternoon so not particularly busy but I think they were just generally understaffed.  Again not a huge deal but it doesn't make the overall experience a good one.  Our staff were ok but you can see they were stretched.  Note to head office - if you understaff your restaurant this impacts on customer service and although you may be saving on salaries in the long run you will end up reducing profits as customers will not return. The food was ok no complaints on the taste although I do think generally the menu is overpriced in comparison to other restaurants. In this case I am likely to go elsewhere as opposed to returning again."

Yes No delicate  small no crust sandwiches.  One scone each with some cream and jam along with 3 small teacakes. Very much like the small packet cakes from Asda.   Dry as a bone. Very short staff. Not one person  asked us if everything  was OK.  I had to go to the bar to ask for a cup of tea as no drink was provided.  Very poor .indeed This was a birthday  gift from my friend to me.  Very disappointed  and ashamed  to have to tell her how bad it really was. We go Portsmouth  cafe rouge  and it is so much better. Staff are present  and food is nice.

Only 2 tables were occupied. Asked to be seated on the padded chairs. Was told 2 persons cannot sit there, these are for 4 persons and she needs these for 7pm. We said we were not stopping long. Quite bite to eat. We thought she would seat us at a 2 person table because the booth tables are made up of two pushed together. What she did was put us on a table she was using as her office. Moved all her devices etc to show us we were inconveniencing her. Bizarre behaviour she started prepping tables with menus at 5pm even the ones next to us while we were dining.  This felt Intimidating and not normal for a manager. We only stayed 1 hour and was gone by 6pm. total opposite to customer service. Abrupt, uncomfortable Behaviour.Beyond belief that despite training her management skills are appalling, hospitality was not there, such poor manners. Not sure where she studied. She did not have a British accent.Spoilt our evening. Cafe rouge is a nice place. We always look forward to eating there. First time at Witney though."

We shared the crab starter, which was fine except for the bread with it which was obviously very stale.  The real problem was with the mains.  My fillet steak was definitely not fillet steak .  It looked like rump, had a lot of sinew and gristle through the middle.  It was happily replaced, but even then the quality of the steak was not good.    My husband's duck was good but came without the vegetables to go with it.  They took  ten minutes to come and were cold.  They kindly refunded the steak, but it was not the quality we expected."

We asked or them rare and were not satisfied with how they had been cooked, so we sent them back. The next set of steaks arrived cold so we sent these back as well. The manager came to talk to us and suggested it was not possible to cook the stakes the way we desired them; I have since done this at home with a similar cut of meat. At one point one of our friends was left alone; she told us that the chef and manger stared at her in a menacing fashion.I settled for a salad which I thought was reasonable but not particularly good value considering the quality and portion size. They had also run out of avocados. On the positive side, we weren’t charged for drinks and the waitresses were helpful. Overall, I found it to be a conformational experience which was poor value for money. Due to my belief the manger’s attitude towards us is systemic of Café Rouge’s approach to customer service I will not be visiting this chain again."

BIRMINGHAMHaving booked a table 2 days previously we were seated next to the bar.  Nobody came to take our drinks order for 20 minutes. The three drinks took 10 minutes to arrive.  Whilst we were waiting for our meals, which took one hour from when we first entered the café the two bar staff in front of us were continually acting like buffoons like a comedy act out of faulty towers. In my opinion this behaviour was totally unprofessional and was in full view of all the customers.  Then the duty manager suddenly started shouting and clapping because some lift had been mended  and she announced it to all the customers that the staff wouldn’t have to now walk up and down the stairs with food.She told us all “ it saved our lives” After 45 minutes of watching this behaviour my husband and I complained to the duty manager about the antics of the two members of staff. She was defensive and condescending and escalated the issue. When the food arrived it was tepid and the portions were very small and plates cold.  We were upset by this whole experience, their unprofessionalism and Staff  acting like silly school kids and the standard that the food arrived in. So we paid for our drinks and left. Horrid experience Unacceptable."

First of all they couldn’t find our booking - even though the person making it had confirmed in person the day before - so we had to wait for them to push tables together. I had the risotto and ate about half - didn’t like it at all, it had a very strange taste and consistency. Rhubarb crumble had a huge piece of almost raw rhubarb and other bits of smaller uncooked rhubarb.  Having seen about the germs often found in ice, I always stress no ice in my drinks - but it arrived with ice and when I asked for it to be changed they merely scooped out some of the ice and gave my drink back to me!One of the group had beans with her dish - and they were so hard she could not eat them.I have since spoken to the 'head' of the group, who feels she should have complained.I remember when you felt you could always get a good meal at a Cafe Rouge.  This was several years ago and I don't know what has happened since then - it was more like eating in a fast food outlet, at restaurant prices."

Trying to book a table by phone as I needed to check if they had certain items available, turned out to be an absolute waste of time. After eight phone calls over a 1 hour period The call is answered automatically, however advises you there’s no one available and then cuts you off, we decided to take a reservation for somewhere that they had actual people that you have a telephone worked. Clearly but whatever the reason your staff do not answer phones. Therefore may I ask why you even bother to list the phone number as that is just pointless and can I say infuriating for customers. Additionally the location is the Lowry, and I will assure you that your location was not jampacked this evening. And if it was jampacked the wonderful thing is at least our party of eight didn’t add to clearly what was such an over populated dining experience, to the extent that not a single person in an hour could answer a phone."

We were served by pretty much every member of staff in the place. My mum ordered omelette with chips which was indicated on the menu to be gluten free, but as she is very sensitive she double checked with the waiter and it was lucky she did as we were informed that the chips are not gluten free. When a waiter approached our table with our meal my mum remarked that she hoped that that wasn't ours, it was. I laughed out loud as the meal looked so poor and pitiful. The '3 free range egg omelette' was a tiny 3 millimetre thick thing served with a tea cup sized stainless steel bowl of leaves, my food was pretty bad, I've eaten at a cafe rouge before and although I don't think it's fabulous I thought the food I've had there previously quite nice. I had cheese on toast, the cheese mixture thick and gloopy with flour, served with a small stainless steel cup of fries pretty much like you'd get from mcdonalds, I also wasn't offered anything in the way of dressings and had to go and hunt down some mayo. We complained and to be fair the young man who we spoke to was most gracious and got a deduction on our bill. My advice would be to avoid at all costs, and at a stupidly overpriced £9.00ish a dish... go to mcdonalds!"

Considering we would go to CR regularly recently they have just lost their quality and service. Our Coffees were cold and returned and replacement not much better. Out Grande Breakfast and Rouge breakfast were all cold, they have changed their Sausage supplier and they taste of not much, bacon is now so thin that you’d probably get 3 from an old serving shrivelled up and just so unappetising. Their beans jug is the smallest I’ve seen I wish I had counted the number of beans on my plate probably 25 beans if I was lucky. The sourdough toast was so hard and cold the table next to us decided to make a brick wall out of them!!!! Service was absolutely awful the manager has to be accountable for this surely? This is a cost cutting exercise at its worst my large plate had more gaps on it then food that’s how bad it was and they call it Grande breakfast? This makes Wetherspoon breakfast a 5 star where I’d normally give it a 2!!! We will not be going back £63 (no tip obviously) for 5 is acceptable but not when you’re being swindled with inferior food and service.To top it all my wife had an upset tummy 2 hours later although I can’t say it was from the breakfast or not... so I won’t mention that too loud.Reevaluate your selves CR or you will lose all your loyal customers."

2,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2022-08-28,Caroline,Think twice about visiting if you have food intolerances or allergies,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","I booked the classic Afternoon Tea online and added a comment about our food requests, ie one vegetarian and my mother's allergies/intolerances in the remarks box.  I further sent an email to the Bournemouth branch to make sure our requirements could be met before arrival (a copy of which I still have).  When we were seated, the waiter brought along the menu.  I mentioned that I had sent in our special requests by email.  He seemed perplexed so the Manager was called over as the waiter could not understand our request for no butter on the bread, no mayo or cream for one and one person is vegetarian.  In discussion with the Manager, he said ""So why are you coming for Afternoon Tea when you can't have butter!""  This made us feel very uncomfortable.  My mother is 91 and cannot tolerate unprocessed butter, fats or cheese of any kind (her mother was the same) but is fine with butter when cooked in cakes, etc.  I said I had sent the branch an email to make sure our food intolerances could be catered for.  He said, ""I don't have time to read emails!"".  In this day and age of so many food allergies and intolerances, isn't it extremely important not to overlook customers' requests?!  The Manager implied that our food allergies and intolerances could be sorted on arrival but, in my experience, every venue we have been to before for Afternoon Tea has requested knowledge of this beforehand.  Despite this, the tea was very nice apart from the hard scone which must have been warmed up in the microwave.  For myself, vegetarian meant brie, brie or brie mini rolls.  I was asked by Cafe Rouge for feedback but, of course, 2 weeks later I have heard nothing!  Will I ever???  I hope so."

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2021-11-11,Julia Davies,Rude customer service at Cribbs Causeway Bristol,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","My daughter and I arrived at Cafe Rouge at The mall Cribbs Causeway Yesterday 10th November, we were hungry and thought we would try Cafe Rouge as we had never eaten there be before, a young dark haired girl said to wait at the entrance and then showed the people in front of us to a table, we waited for about 15 minutes then an older lady possibly French eventually came towards us, she totally ignored us and beckoned the 4 women who were behind us to walk in front of us???? She showed them to a table, ok we thought, we’re hungry and thought she would then come back and show us to a smaller table but nope, she then walked up to another table and started casually chatting to them, I looked over and smiled, she looked over but didn’t even acknowledge us, just proceeded to ignore us and just left us standing there. What dreadful customer service. We then walked over to another eatery upstairs, what a difference, the gentleman was polite, greeted us straightaway, even though they were busy, he took our names and asked us if we would like to sit at the entrance and then he would call us to a table as soon as one was available. Cafe rouge needs to have a staff meeting on politeness training."

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2020-03-06,Barbara,Lost their way totally,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","This review isn't about a particular location of this restaurant or the staff.  We have for many years gone to Cafe Rouge and visited several locations over the years and found the service good and the food fine so long as you have a special deal or vouchers to use.  Otherwise it is constantly overpriced for what you get.  Now however they have totally lost their way.  In the past it has not been a problem to get a gluten free meal.  Now however you have to download an App onto your phone screen and figure out from that what you can/cannot eat ..... and now the best answer I believe is to get up and go somewhere else!  Why? ..... for pretty much everything they have managed to find a way to get gluten into it!!! Our server was very sympathetic and helpful and eventually went to the kitchen to speak to the chef and look on packet ingredients and between them I got a meal.  It was dry, very overcooked and poor quality but that's another problem altogether.  How on earth did they think this was a good idea!  It has not been thought through at all.  You are expected to be able to spend the first 20 mins of a dinner occasion trying to read unclear information on a tiny phone screen.  It's not even well laid out - even our server found it difficult to match what was on the menu to what was on the phone screen.  The long and short of it is that Cafe Rouge have lost us as customers but they have now also lost all the people that we previously would have agreed to meet there to eat with plus my family, friends etc etc...Big mistake, Big! Huge! (with apologies to Pretty Woman)"

2,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2017-09-24,Katie E,Café rouge Sheffield - will not be going again,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","Usually whenever my family come up to Sheffield (from starting uni in 2013) I have always enjoyed Café rouge - the atmosphere, the food and the staff have always been great. After a trip to them today however, I can say for definite that I won't be going again. The lack of professionalism, poor quality food and lack of apology really did ruin a family birthday outing. I had noticed the last time I went that although the food seemed to continually go up in price that it wasn't really improving in quality, and we all left this time feeling very underwhelmed with the food itself. However, the main issue was something that had happened between the manager and a member of behind the bar staff who proceeded to take his anger out on the dishes and slammed them around all while we were trying to eat and chat relaxed (doesn't help that there is no door for the kitchen). The restaurant was not busy at all, yet it felt like they were all as stressed as though it was. It got to the point where my mum had to say something and the response we had from the waitress was 'well you see if it was busy you wouldn't really hear it' as though nothing had happened and didnt even apologise to us explicitly; despite the fact the staff member was much louder than anyone else and practically smirked at us while he did it. The manager seemed like he wanted nothing to do with it and made no attempt to come over and talk to us or even tell us he was going to sort out things with the angry member of staff. I'd never felt so poorly handled as a customer who's worked in customer service since being 15 - considering the £104 bill with 25% discount - and that my family had come for a nice relaxing meal and we had to go have a coffee in Costa we felt so uncomfortable. Poor management at the most basic level and I felt sorry for the waitress trying her best to feedback to us whilst also trying to politely ask the member of staff to not be so noisy who was not having any of it. Ridiculous."

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2019-03-09,Miki ,Cafe Rouge - Bromley,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","The worst customer service I’ve ever seen, and I’ve watched Fawlty Towers. Picture the scene, my girlfriend and I enter the Café, well-presented and suitably hungry. We’d ventured forth in the search for a bit of breakfast to satiate the hunger we’d developed over a hectic morning.  We were greeted by what I can only assume was a lady who hated her job more than anything, who found it particularly annoying to have to lead us to a table. We sat down, unperturbed by the strange, almost eerie start to our visit. After 25 minutes of patiently waiting, the same member of staff returned to our table and asked for our order, in a manner that was akin to, “You want something to eat or what?” We decided to stay the course, regardless of the fact the members of staff clearly hated the place they worked and all of the people in it. We made our order, lips wet with anticipation. The table next to us received their food about 10 minutes after we made our order, with both of the guests having to send the food back as the orders were wrong. Not a great start, I’m sure you’d agree. Still, we wanted to believe in the best of people. Now, the restaurant was not even that busy. There were numerous free tables and more than enough staff members to run the place. We waited, while none of the staff did. They stood around cleaning tables that were already clean, watching as we sat there food-less and wasting away. We waited for a full hour without any sign of our food or drinks making it to our table. I can only assume the chef was in the back cooking with a Bunsen burner. The hour passed, with my lovely, patient girlfriend and I debating whether to just leave. She had ordered a coffee, myself a coke or something. After about half an hour we saw our drinks appear on the bar, but unfortunately we were the only ones who did. We watched, helpless, as all the warmth escaped the coffee’s cup. As the fizz left the coke for pastures new. For half an hour the drinks stayed there, and after a while we just wanted to see how long they’d be left there out of morbid curiosity. The drinks remained untouched and unserved the whole time we were there. None of the staff asked us if we’d been served, or if we wanted to pay, or anything. There was a total absence of care, all staff members were absolutely miserable and outright rude to everybody in the place. When we left, I politely said to the woman behind the bar, “You might want to pour those away, as they were for us.” She replied, super aggressively, “well I don’t know, I’m just a bartender”. Firstly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with tending bar and secondly if I was tending a bar - I think I’d tend to notice two drinks waiting on top of it for the best part of an hour. Alas, we left. Still hungry but now also a little bit disillusioned. We went to Patisserie Valerie and it was perfect."

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2019-02-08,Mrs G Coyle,Ripped off -and head office don't care either!,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","Cafe Rouge was a firm favourite with my 4 girl friends and I given its city centre location, almost equidistant from our homes.  We visit regularly usually paying full price, and for the first time took advantage of a Groupon deal of £38 for four starters and four mains, it being a quiet Monday in January, so intending to pay for the one extra meal for the fifth person, plus of course drinks, coffees & puds. As usual, the food was pretty good and ticked all the right boxes for a mid-week girls night. The service was also good, attentive, but never overbearing. But that’s where the good news ends, sadly :( As is the way with a group of pals, one person has bought the vouchers, and paid in advance, two or three pay in cash, so the one with the debit card, looks after the balance, so we should have been more on the ball at the time, but the complexity of splitting fairly, and giving the extra money back to the voucher buyer, distracted us from the bill content. So it wasn’t until the next day that we realised we massively over-charged! Instead of the voucher covering FOUR lots of starter & main, (so we should ONLY have paid for drinks, I starter, one main & two puds, and two coffees) the waitress charged us for EVERYTHING we ordered at full price, then even added a supplement for each, before deducting the £38 like it was a simple PREPAYMENT when It wasn’t. Basically, we not only paid full price for everything, but we paid in advance for the privilege! The bill should have been approx £60 less than we were charged. So you would think that after 6 calls, leaving messages for the manager, over three days, an email conversation, which he responded to saying he needed our itemised receipt, despite having supplied the groupon vouchers, our online booking ref, our table number AND our payment amounts  (and we were the only table of 5 in a dead restaurant, who were also last to leave!) you'd think we’d have received a sincere apology and a refund? And maybe even a wee voucher to encourage us to come back? Nope! Despite no understanding (and I mean comprehension!) from the manager than you can't charge for meals AND add a £3 supplement, and the same response to my now 2nd request by email to their head office, they still don't begin to get it.  They claim that the surcharges are correct (accepting that the £3 supplement) on the full price meal WAS an error! And offered us a £3 refund!) Talk about insult to injury?So what that means is despite being regular customers, who WERE advocates of the business, this has left a very sour taste in our mouths. One not usually associated with French food! So be warned. Check your bill carefully and don’t rely on the Cafe Rouge Edinburgh to honour these voucher deals they way they should, which is four FREE starters and mains (because the voucher you've prepaid covers them!) with bills for any additional food & drink.    So guess, Cafe Rouge? You’ve just lost 5 advocates for your business, who won’t be shy in sharing our experience! It will, you’ll note, cost you a LOT more than the actual cost of putting this right.  If they DO choose to refund, this review will be updated to that effect. But don't hold your breath, as there is simply no cure for deliberate overcharging.  Finally, as an update, we've since heard of two other friends who have been overcharged in exactly the same manner.  One raised it in the restaurant and had the bill amended, the other, like us, left to stew over it later.  We'll just leave that with you!"

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2018-04-30,Paul Gernon,Awful Experiance,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","My wife, children and I arrived at around 11.45 to Hampstead.  We asked for a table of four and the rude hostess made a fuss as we had not reserved.  This was astonishing as the restaurant, while busy was not full and at no stage neared capacity during our visit.  We were seated next to a toilet.  And I mean right next to one.  The smell was awful and we asked to be moved after a while.  I do not understand why there is a table there and the manager of this location should be informed it is not acceptable.  After somewhat of a fuss we were moved and we were seated.  We ordered and were largely ignored for some 45 minutes until we enquired as to how long more the food might be as the children were hungry.  The food began to arrive shortly there after.  Firstly please inform your chef that for children they should not add any salt to fries.  A little salt may have been okay but this was shocking.  The amount of salt was amazing.  For the kids we ordered Bangers and mash.  this could not be eaten.   The mash was cold and tasted like smash with some dried herbs put into it.  The bangers were cheap and clearly microwaved.  They were awful. Cheese burger and chips. I have already addressed the salt issue.  They burger was a frozen cheap burger which my daughter refused to eat.  I tasted it and frankly I have had much better at music festivals.  It was awful. It was cheap, just cheap.  I ordered myself a chicken baguette.  It was an undercooked from frozen Demi baggage with a little mayo, some sad salad and rubber chicken which was clearly cooked previously and heated back up.  It was frankly foul.  My wife ordered the mushroom pancake.  It was dreadful.  Burnt to a crisp and not eatable.  I have no idea how it left the kitchen.  All of the food was awful.  We asked for the bill and it was given to us and we paid.  At no stage did anyone ask us why we had not eaten our food, if everything was alright etc.  It was a truly awful dining experience.  All together it was around 40 pounds.  Now I don't mind what I pay for food so long as it is good, however the quality of the food, mixed with the poor service, made this shocking.  I am appalled as to how you have allowed one of your locations become so poor."

1,Caferouge,['Restaurant'],1.9,2019-08-22,Lydia,Lack of customer service and people skills,"Café Rouge - Bar, Restaurant and Café","Well I have to say massively disappointed about the rude, blarsay, unprofessional restaurant manager her attitude and unprofessionalism was embarrassing and uncomfortable.I’d brought the breakfast for 2 via Groupon £14.95 2 inc 2 drinks and breakfast. To use in the Cafe Rouge in the BullringUpon arrival and service throughout was fantastic the waiter who served me before was lovely and hospitable and went above and beyond whilst waiting on us. Now it was not until the end when I asked for the bill that ( I believe she was the restaurant manager/supervisor) proceeded to scan the code then walked to the waiter and said she was charging us for drinks, within hearing distant. So I looked at the voucher and read what it inc as she kept saying it’s not fruit juice it’s not fruit juice’ and the waiter was trying to explain what we had, to which I then said on the voucher it says you could have lemonade, coke etc  and my friend had order a coke and sparkling water and I had a mocha and lemon gomme press then she turned to me and very rudely raised her voice ‘ it’s fine it’s fine I’ve sorted it’ she shoved a receipt into the waiters hand and stormed off. The waiter a bit frazzled came over and gave us the receipt, I looked at it and we’d been charged for sparkling water as my friend opted for that and a coke. So I queried the charge initially with the waiter as we’d brought the groupon which included 2 drinks but she was hovering around and then piped up, chiming in about that sparking water isn’t inc in the Groupon offer, really it’s water, there was a choice of lemonade, coke, lemon presse, tea, coffee etc but she couldn’t have included a bottle of sparking water instead of the others?! Was it really that deep ???  Getting all attitude and blarsay and unprofessional in her responses which is what narked me off, if she had any skills or professionalism about her she would of said before we ordered ‘ Ohhh just to let you know x, y & z are not inc with the offer’  that would of been fine not a problem we’d of chosen something else. But no instead she mouthed off at me saying‘Yeh but is sparkling water It’sparkling water anyone would of thought this water was from the frigging fountain of youth for goodness sake!! She kept saying ‘I have to account for it and it’s not included etc etc’  so I said well ok that’s  fine, the situation didn’t warrant her attitude and the way she chose to conduct herself in the restaurant, as the waiter was trying to explain and she cut him off she then went around the restaurant floor to repeat loud enough for me to hear to the other waiter and to 2 bar staff about the ‘sparkling water’ she carried on the situation instead of being professional and delivering good customer service. She then came over and said ‘ I can take it off the bill’ but again her attitude when she said that to me was rude and abrupt, I was happy to pay but her response was rude! what she needed to of done is said ‘look I’m really sorry sparkling water isn’t included in the offer, I apologise that this wasn’t reiterated when you placed your order, however on this occasion with the misunderstanding I’ll take it off for you’ that’s customer service if that conversation had happened I would not have had an issue... she was rude, abrupt, completely unprofessional and didn’t resolve the situation in a mature way."

The gravy with added bone marrow was nothing short of awesome.   Afters were sticky toffee pudding, toffe sauce and clotted cream which went down a treat.

The portions were huge, even my husband who has a huge appetite couldn't finish the steak. The sticky toffee pudding was excellent when we managed to eat it the following day.Customer service was excellent when I raised a query prior to and post delivery.  Highly recommended"

From what my Dad told me and having seen the impressive photos, my Mum and he absolutely loved the whole experience (and are saving the sticky toffee pudding for tomorrow). My Dad said that it was one of the best steak dinners that he can remember having - and if that’s not an endorsement, I don’t know what is! Thanks Hawksmoor - love your restaurants and it’s brilliant that you’re really delivering on the @home experience too."

I’ve always been a little reticent about getting restaurant meals delivered to home. This, however, has blown that out the water. Delivered on time.

5,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2021-03-15,Rose T,Delicious and easy to prepare,,"I have ordered two boxes so far, my favourite was the Porterhouse box from March. To be honest I was quite nervous spending so much money on a meal kit that involved my (lack of) skill to cook the main ingredient and wasn't convinced it would in anyway reflect a true Hawksmoor experience. However I was happily surprised. The time consuming elements like sauces and sides are all ready prepared and taste fabulous, super easy to heat up. The video tutorial for preparing the steaks was very clear and easy to follow and the steaks turned out perfectly both times. Although nothing will ever really beat the in restaurant experience,  this came very close and brought back lovely memories. All in all, a lovely treat which we really enjoyed."

It was delicious, definitely on par with what you get served in the restaurant. The wines were beautifully chosen and complimented the food so well. The best thing was how easy everything was to prepare and clean up and the environmentally friendly packaging. I would definitely order Hawksmoor at home again for a special occasion (if we couldn't make it to the restaurant itself!!)"

1,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2021-05-08,MOTLeeds,"Terrible steaks, atrocious quality but resolved well",,"Bought 3 Hawksmoor steaks via the Ocado site, a 1Kg Porterhouse, a centre cut fillet and a ribeye. All 3 steaks were very poor, I presume these are the same steaks as available via Hawksmoor direct. The Porterhouse has more bone , a thick layer of fat and gristle than meat. I will struggle to feed 1 person with a 1Kg steak.The ribeye has loads of fat and gristle and doesn't look at all appetising or indeed a prime steak.The fillet is a long tail end and not as described a centre cut.I am very disappointed and angry about these steaks as I bought as a special treat and I am reluctant to use them as I fear the worst.Following this review I have had further communication from Alex at Hawksmoor and the matter has been very satisfactorily resolved. I am very happy to hear that they take the issue of steak quality very seriously and that this was probably a one off issue."

I emailed them within half an hour of making the booking, and they promised to cancel and refund my card. When Valentine's Day arrived, so did the (very expensive) box as they had failed to cancel the order. We decided to keep the box and not request a refund, but did let the restaurant know that they had failed to cancel the order. There was no reply, even after my follow up requesting the General Manager's contact details. So: 3* rating for poor service. The food was superb though - steak was divine, chips were excellent and very similar to the restaurant. Don't expect them to get back to you though if you order."

All I would say to the Hawksmoor standard. Portions were perfect and the quality was as good as the restaurant.The instructions were written down and you had video tutorials or the opportunity for a live cook a long. I had no issues with delivery and I can see now they do weekends too.Looking at the website now there is an even bigger selection but sadly it looks to be ending once the restaurant opens again so get in there quick!

Having the option to order the restaurant quality food delivered to your door is such a great addition to the brand. I was gifted a surprise lockdown Hawksmoor at home fillet meal for 2, including wine, beers and cocktails and it was simply superb. Everything from the packaging to the product is of the highest quality with great care for every detail. It really shows and really makes this a stand out offering. The portions were rich and generous. (300g fillet steaks!) Drinks were plentiful and it made for a really special night. I’ve since managed to return to the restaurants since they have re-opened for the full experience. But plan to use Hawksmoor at Home for entertaining on special occasions. It is really worth the money in my opinion."

As soon as we walked in we were met by two very charming members of staff that took us upstairs to the restaurant. The service throughout was second to none and we were made to feel very welcome and relaxed. My son said it was the best roast dinner he has ever had. The chef Matty surprisingly came to the table to meet us after we had asked for them to send the chef our compliments. If you go to this restaurant make sure you try their “old fahshions”

2,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2022-08-02,M Ribeiro,Overpriced for dry Steaks + casual service!,,"Took the kids and wife for a day out in London to celebrate my wife’s birthday.After enjoying a very entertaining boat trip with the ‘Terrible Thames’ ( Horrible Histories) we had to Covent Garden for a meal and some retail therapy.We were recommended by friend to go and check Hawksmoor out.We walked in and they accommodated us straight away (Monday 4pm) no drama there.The menu was a bit restricted for the kids but we managed to get a smaller steak for my son (10yo) and bacon and chips for my daughter (7yo) which was fine.The smoked salmon starter was delicious and my kids wanted another one plus some extra rye bread .Service was very casual, it took ages to order extra bread. We only succeed after ordering for the third time, having in mind there were only 7 tables taken and loads of staff chatting by the bar. (It doesn’t take long to get another 2 slices of bread from the kitchen).The steaks came looking so dry and tasted juicyless. It probably was under the hot lamp waiting for us to finish our starters.After paying £228, for 2 steaks, 1 burger,  bacon chips and a bottle of Shiraz (£54) which was average and 2 starters. I will not waste my money in this restaurant ever again. This is not comparison to Gaúcho or nowhere near Milker and Carter where you can eat better quality steaks, better service and 30% cheaper at least.Very disappointed!!!"

This is the third Hawksmoor  at Home that we have had and all have been fabulous. The meat is amazing, lots of flavour and very tender. It is maybe more expensive than some cook at home kits but the quality is well worth it.There was a small problem with the bbq pack and I contacted Hawksmoor on the day and got a reply back from Tristan within minutes. The problem was resolved to a very high standard and I can’t fault their customer service.Will definitely be using them again in the future."

Lovely corner table ready for us. Impeccable service, waited on hand and foot by our lovely waiter Alex. Then, unfortunately, the gutter decided to spit out some cretins who decided to sit next to us on a 6 person table, only to squeeze in additional guests later on. One particular individual produced his BYOB from his pocket and proceeded to pour into the glass on the table! The conversation was delightful, full of stories of how he had been called to court on a murder charge and F this and C that. Delightful. (I hope you're reading this by the way....).Grace, the Manager handled the situation beautifully and couldn't have been more apologetic. Sending over complimentary drinks and desserts.Couldn't recommend enough.To the absolute troglodyte who thought spending a lot of money meant you could do as you wished......remember, you can have all the money in the world, but it won't buy you class!To end, I would recommend the Hawksmoor, not just for the food, but also the service. Just a shame my boyfriends first experience was tainted somewhat but the party of utter twonks next to us."

1,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2021-09-18,Jennifer Walker,Not fit for purpose,,"Unfortunately the packaging and delivery service (via DPD) is not fit for purpose. I have now had 3 failed attempts at a delivery of a single order (2 didn't make it past DPD depot and one that was delivered with wine pouring out of it on my doorstep). The customer service team are great are organising a replacement box (but it just won't actually get to you) and listening to feedback about the issues, but it evidently isn't taken on board as this morning's notification from DPD that my box was on its way back to Hawksmoor illustrates. A great shame, but 3 failed deliveries out of 3 attempts isn't a fluke. If you get your food, it will be lovely, but just bear in mind that there is a significant risk of the delivery not actually being made."

It was FANTASTIC, beef was so tender and tasty, all the veg and ""trimmings"" were top quality too. Best roast beef dinner I've ever had, and, as I said to Tristan by email, as I'm 69 I've had quite a few!!We had a good ""blow out"" with substantial helpings. There was quite a bit of beef left over which went into cold beef sandwiches for Monday lunch (yum), and still a bit left for Tuesday! Quite a bit of veg left over, which, with a little top up, will become bubble and squeak for Monday dinner with sausages.  The red wine and champagne was very good too (not much of that left over!). Highly recommended 😁"

We actually ate it over 2 nights as we didn’t think we would be able to eat the ribs as a starter without spoiling the main course a bit. I’m really glad we did as the ribs and slaw were amazing so we had 2 dinners! The cocktails were lovely and I drank mine whilst cooking. Maybe that’s why I was so relaxed. The red wine stretched over both nights.It is all so easy to cook so no worries there.I nearly forgot the sticky toffee pudding. Simply the best pudding we’ve had in a long, long time."

Our son did the cooking and have to say the meal was excellent. Couldn’t fault the steak with the two sauces. The ribs to start were just succulent. The accompanying drinks went well with the meal and all of the meal was excellent value.Came very well boxed and packaged. I would highly recommend anyone try these. Will be doing this again.

2,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2022-08-06,Pada Kay,Appalling service.,,"This was meant to be a pleasant experience. My daughter had just submitted her course work after having slogged away at it for weeks. We decided to celebrate on that Friday and so she booked a table at a restaurant. She then texted me back to say that she had changed the booking and booked it at Hawksmoor instead as she preferred to go there. We had been there quite a few times before and had liked it a lot. We arrived for 8 and were shown to our table. It was very busy, and the tables were packed closely together, so much so I could not get into my seat. I also accidentally knocked off the jacket of the lady seated behind me. I therefore asked to be seated at the next table and was kindly allowed to change the table. We ordered our drinks and starters and by the time we got them it was well past 8:30. When we finished the plates were removed and we waited for the main course. It was more than 35 minutes before we even got a chance to speak to a waiter. In the mean while the couple to my right who were in the middle of their starters when we arrived had finished their main course and had paid their bill and left. They were soon followed by another couple who were well into their starters and we still had not got our main course. The man and his son to my left who were seated after we had arrived had also finished their starter and their main course and paid and left. This was very frustrating to watch. We enquired as to what was happening about the time it was taking as both tables on either side had left. We were told that we were third in the queue. This really annoyed me. How could we be third when other people on tables nearby who had come after us had finished and left. When I questioned that, I was told something about temperatures. All the tables around me had ordered a steak like us and I asked how long it takes to make a steak and a burger and why was it longer than the tables on either side of us. They then came back and asked whether we wanted to eat or pay the bill and cancel the meal. This at a quarter to ten when we would not be able to go anywhere else to eat. We decided to eat any way and the meal was subsequently brought to us. The bun of the burger was burnt and to add insult to injury there was a plastic bit in the burger. By this time we had lost our appetite and any desire to eat. I was asked how the meal was!!. Waiter/manager said this was not a place to have this conversation and they would email us!! We asked the remainder of the steak to be packed for my dogs. Waiter came and brought the bag and offered us a box of chocolates which was a nice enough gesture but was not satisfactory at all. Our whole evening was ruined and what was meant to be an enjoyable meal was a disaster. The service was appalling, and I was deeply disappointed. In all fairness the steak was soft and cooked to perfection when I cut it up for the dogs later. The food has always been good in the Knightsbridge branch of Hawksmoor. Shame we could not enjoy the food due to the abysmal service. I regret to say I shall not be coming to Hawksmoor or be recommending it for some time to come."

I made a complaint about the quality of the food and didn’t hear anything so made a complaint through PayPal as it was inedible, PayPal made the decision to refund me as the company didn’t communicate and now this company is harassing me, threatening me they are going to take legal action on me, get me done for fraud etc etc unless I bank transfer them the money that was charged back. I have spoken to paypal who have told me to ignore the emails, not to pay any money as I have done no wrong doing and to tell company to contact them as it them who made the decision however the company are still emailing me, threatening me all these months down the line. I have now had to proceed down the legal route myself and take this to the my local authorities as I feel harassed and this is causing me extreme anxiety!!Avoid this company like the plague!

The main app doesn't even work and their Web app is shockingly bad. I placed an order and paid using PayPal, the app then stopped working and didn't process the order, but PayPal still took my money, so I asked PayPal to refund it. I then tried again using my bank details and it worked. Only the order that was confirmed using my bank details was delivered. This was in September 2023.Its now January 2024 and I've only now recieved an email threatening legal action against me because they want a £14 processing fee for refunding via PayPal and claiming that order had been fulfilled. Included in this email was an email directed to another customer breaking GDPR rules, and another 2 directed towards me that had been made to look as though they had already tried to contact me. This email with 3 ""responses"" was the only communication I had recieved from them.Their terms and conditions do not mention any processing fee and claim that unless an order is confirmed you are not entitled to a refund. The original order I placed was not confirmed therefore I was entitled to get my money back. The 2nd order I placed (for the same amount) was confirmed and the food was delivered.So, if you like emails threatening legal action over money that you don't owe and your personal data being passed around, then definitely use it! But if I were you I'd steer well clear of this app."

At 20.35 and 2 calls to the vendor later, who assured us the food had been sent with the driver 20 minutes earlier, still no whereabouts of order. Finally arrived at 20.55.

You neglect the diversity of your customers in favour for what you believe is trending. I don't eat halal & i don't eat lamb. i don't allow companies to force a product on me just because they don't cater to my needs. I am not alone in this opinion.

I waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for 3 basic dishes. The food was warm but not piping hot, the chicken soup was very oily and the chicken used in all 3 of my dishes was rubbery. Rubbery chicken is a sign of frozen chicken being used, not freshly cooked chicken. 
I can safely say I won't be ordering from them again, especially as my order came to over £10 and I still had to pay £1.50 for delivery and another 50p for using a debit card making it a pricey meal that was poor standard :("

However I ordered takeaway on a Saturday afternoon from Stockport shop. It took 1.5 hours to arrive. I rang 15 minutes before it arrived and was told the driver had it. It is approximately a 4 minute drive. The food was luke warm and all the dishes were bland including Thai red curry which was not at all hot and the pawns were mushy textured. The only thing that was ok was the thai prawn crackers. I emailed to explain this and received no response so a week later emailed the head office and received no reply. This is terrible customer service and terrible food, I will not go there again and will make sure no one I know does either."

 The restaurant managed to mess my order up and instead of sending a Beef main dish, sent one with Prawns. On double checking my order, the email confirmatins said 'Beef', not prawns. I called them and they apologised and promised my next main would be free on a subsequent order.
 This evening I have called them to claim that main dish and been told the following:
1. They can send the main dish and my side dish of singapore noodles but because it's not coming from a local branch the minimum spend is £20. To clarify, I didn't spend £20 on the initial order they got wrong and it's not my issue that they send the order from a completely different branch.
2. Because they got the order wrong they were willing to make the minimum charge £15 but would not send a driver to me to collect for less than this.
3. The lady I spoke to said she was trying to find a solution but could not offer me anything else and wouldn't send a driver for less than £15, let's not forget that they got the order wrong and so now I'm being requested to pay extra for that.
 I will not order from this restaurant again and would urge others to check their order immediately on receiving it. I had soup and did not check my main until it was too late. 
 Customer service is clearly not on their agenda and I will not be ordering from them again."

With over 25 years of history, Paya has stood the test of time because of the quality of its food, service and surroundings"".","They use ready made sauces and curry pastes which claim to have no msg, but something in their food does. and a lot of it. I ate a normal amount, and had a strong msg reaction. Headache, rapid heart rate, sickness in stomach, stinging and itching on skin and feeling pretty bad all round.
 Spoke with the manager and refused a refund, he was adamant there was no msg in the food. I tried to explain that the food companies are deceptive nowadays and it was definitely in something in their food, even if it wasn't labelled. 
 Finally he offered to give me a discount next time, which wasn't much use. In the end he agreed to send out an order with no curry sauce or pastes from their bought in bottles and some egg fried rice. Which i think was reasonable. 
 If there was no msg or similar toxins in this food i would rate the restaurant 4 stars as the staff are respectful and the actual taste of the food is 4 stars or so. Price however is too high to justify.
 I won't order from here again because i value my health and after this strong msg reaction and the adamant and honest belief from the manager that no msg was in the food, clearly they don't know what is in it, and as they don't make their food from scratch and instead use cheap bought in pastes [coarse language] I won't be wasting my money here again. 
 Whether it is specifically msg or not, it is something very close to that and very unhealthy. Giving a strong and almost immediate bad reaction in me. Someone who is very healthy."

I placed an order at 7pm, with expected delivery 8pm.  At 8.15pm I tried calling the Ewell branch, again at 8.30pm, 8.45pm, 9pm and 9.30pm each time an automated voice told me there was no one to answer my call and to leave a message.  There’s no customer service number or email, so I used the Paya Webchat to find out what was happening.  They couldn’t assist me as they only deal with the website. They confirmed my order, but couldn’t give an ETA and basically told me not worry it should arrive soon, but to keep calling the number!At this point I just wanted to cancel, but unable to do that, I contacted my bank for advice, and was told the transaction had already gone through.  The bank gave me a number for what I assumed was customer services, but no it was the Webchat, who repeated what was said earlier.  After waiting 2 hours I was past being hungry,  but I was stuck unable to cancel an order, that I no longer wanted and could very well turn up at midnight.  But that seems acceptable to Paya as long as it’s delivered job done. At 9:52pm  I got a call from the driver, he couldn’t find my address, so could I come and collect it from him in the street.  Turns out he had gone to the wrong building, what was more incredulous he had actually parked directly in front of my building!  The food I waited nearly 3 hours and no longer wanted arrived cold, congealed and didn’t look appetising at all.  It’s no surprise that after reheating in the microwave it was completely tasteless.   Paya took my money and I didn’t get what I paid for.  They promised to deliver in an acceptable time frame fresh, hot and tasty food.  They did neither,  and I can’t complain to Paya as they have no customer services.Awful!"

With over 25 years of history, Paya has stood the test of time because of the quality of its food, service and surroundings"".","Really fancied Thai food as it's so fresh tasting and colourful and Paya Friend Barnet came up in the search engine as the only place that delivered to my post code. I ordered chicken satay and crispy crab claws with plum sauce for starters and chicken pad Thai for myself and Chicken Green curry for my sister. When they delivered the driver complained that there was no parking near my home and he had to park a mile away and walk a mile.
The food arrived in lovely containers and got chop sticks. The peanut sauce for the satay chicken was warm and of jelly consistency and the crispy crab claws came with a chilli sauce and both tasted awful and bland.
At this point I rang the restaurant to say the sauces are wrong and spoke to Mohsen who was in denial that the crispy crab claws come with a plum sauce, after checking he agreed. He informed me that their peanut sauce always came like that. I told him I was left dissatisfied with the starters and wanted a refund on these and that we had not yet tasted the mains. He told me that because I paid by card online that he was unable to refund my card but could offer a credit note. I told him I was not satisfied with the starters and would not be coming buying from food again therefore a credit note was pointless.
When I asked for a refund on my card he said if his driver had taken the payment at the door on his credit card machine then a refund could be given but because it was done over the web page this wasn't permitted, however he would speak to his manager. He kept me waiting for a few minutes and came back on the line and told me his manager said no refund only credit. I asked to be put through to the manager and he said I called him and this is what he said.
Then he got angry and told me that I hadn't even tried the main and what was I complaining about, I hung up the phone as I felt I was getting angry.
My sister and i tried the mains - Chicken Thai green curry that tasted like chicken swimming in dish water and my Chicken Pad Thai that tasted like crushed peanuts smeared over over cooked noodles with overcooked chicken - disgusting.
My sister and I gathered all the food and threw it in the bin and called Top Wok to place a chinese meal as Paya and their Thai food definitely did not live up to to our expectations nor look as advertised on their web page.
I called the restaurant back and asked to speak to Mohsen, when he came on the line I told him the mains were disgusting too, and that originally I was not asking for a full refund, but now will be writing to his manager demanding a full refund to which he replied that he was surprised as I was the first person to complain about the food. I told him the chef hasn't a clue how to make Thai food.
PLEASE NEVER BUY FOOD FROM THIS PLACE."

First time something like this we saw at the restaurant in Manchester. Everyone dealt with us with nice smile and gave welcoming vibes. Only issue which we found was with the spice.  We ordered Mild spice, food came which was hot for us.I hope it keeps its standard like this. Well done to all the team."

We were welcomed by a lovely man named Khan, he definitely had great customer service skills. He gave us the menu and asked to look through it and if it appealed to us he would direct us to a table he could tell we looked unsure my body language must have gave it away. I appreciated the fact he wanted us to make our own judgment. My husband and I were ready to be seated, the food didn’t take long to arrive and I’m glad I made the right choice the food was delicious.Mr Khan came to check if the food was ok, the waiters asked us if we needed anything else.

Also I will be adding on trust pilot, even when I asked receipt of detailed food they said we can’t give you due to tax purposes."

H,I visited this place yesterday,"A modern, contemporary twist on a variety of different Cuisines!","I visited this place yesterday, we did not have to wait long and was seated, however the food was just average nothing special. The kids meal chips and chicken nuggets were 6 pounds you would expect maybe a fruit shoot or a children drink with that for that price. The thing that really dissapointed me was the mocktails I asked for a Pina colda which had a very soar taste when i informed the waiter he kindly offered to replace it with a mango mocktail however this did not taste like a mocktail it tasted like a rubicon mango with added ice and some mint leaves. Which is not good as you paying nearly 5 pounds for a drink.Overall I do feel the place needs to upgrade the food to reflect their prices, also they refused to give us tap water and wanted us to buy bottled water or drinks 🤷‍♀️"

2,Mussarats,['Restaurant'],4.4,2021-09-08,Nazmeen Hussainkhan,Overall...disappointing,"A modern, contemporary twist on a variety of different Cuisines!","The atmosphere and staff were good. However, food and drink gets 2 stars. the mock tails were a combination of sprite and mango juice and the rest of the food was very average,  and over priced. I was so disappointed by the mixed grill, and lasagne was served on its own, the chips had to be ordered separate.Lastly, the chicken achari was tasteless and a very small portion. On a positive the staff are very attentative...but please don't ask customers to leave a positive review (for the named waiter)when you clearly knew we were disappointed by the food. You didn't even offer a replacement curry to take home, which other restaurants do.This restaurant is on curry mile Manchester...and with all the competition around them they really need to up their game in terms of taste and presentation of food and drink."

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

","We are delighted with the service provided by Dinggly! Our front of house team said that it totally transformed service on the first night we tried the call button and pagers. We had tried many options, including intrusive sounding door bells, but nothing worked properly. That’s why we approached Dinggly who explained how everything worked and gave us different options. After the trial period, there was no doubt that we were keeping the system. Brilliant!!"

",I would highly recommend this company. They made us some custom buzzers with pagers and tailored them to exactly what we wanted. We changed the button design and Ed sorted this really quickly. We received the buzzer system for trial quicker than quoted which was brilliant. It came with excellent instructions. The support once we had the system installed is brilliant. Any little query was sorted by the customer service team but mainly Ed who quickly responds and couldn’t be more helpful. It will make a huge difference to our business and is great to deal with such a friendly conscientious company.

","We've been using Dinggly watches and alert systems for a few years now. As it is hardware that is worn by waiters and waitresses, the watches get put through the ringer (pardon the pun), and as such, they do sometimes break or malfunction. Though the support team are available at all times of the day to remotely access and fix software issues and are quick to send out and replace watches or tablets if we damage them beyond repair.We would recommend Dinggly to other businesses in the Hospitality industry who are looking for a discreet way to alert and notify waiting staff that food or drinks are ready."

","We were one of the first manufacturing facilities to use Dinggly as a production tool.  Ed at Dinggly was instrumental in getting this project up quickly and efficiently.  Dinggly has changed the game for us in how we communicate with our operators on a noisy plant floor.  They are also not shy in improving their product.  When we were starting up, any complaints we had were quickly addressed and new things were integrated at surprising speed.  I am very impressed with their ingenuity and willingness to help out.

","We are a small boutique hotel that struggled for years to find a reliable way for guests call for service at our front desk.  Now with Dinggly, we finally have a button that will notify our Guest Service staff anywhere in our 23,000 sq. ft. brick and stone building.  Service and support has been great!  Our first button became less responsive to the touch.  When we reached out 6 months after implementing Dinggly in August of 2022, we had a new button in less than a week!  The one feature we would love to see improved, is a longer ring tone, to be sure we do not miss the call."

","Covid 19 impacted every business, hospitality though had to completely change the way it interacted with guests, no bar service, outside only, social distancing. With a large outdoor area we had to find a way of both utilising the space and being able to off the very best & safe service to our guests. I researched table call buttons as we recognised that this could be a really effective way of putting people at ease whilst at the same time providing a unique service. I worked closely with Ed whilst still in the first lockdown and we came up with a perfect solution in the correct timescale to ensure that we were ready to go as soon as we had the green light to open. Fast forward 18 months and its safe to say the decision to go with Dinggly has transformed our business. Our guests absolutely love it, no queuing at the bar or trying to attract the attention of a member of staff, simply press the button!I would have no hesitation in recommending Dinggly, Ed has and continues to be our key contact and any minor issues we have had are always dealt with (most of the time it being our tech). Finally it's probably worth pointing out that we get so many positive reviews ourselves based on the table call buttons which helps generate both repeat and new business."

The staff were very helpful too. Even though we did not pay for the ""view room"" option, our room on the twentieth floor had a great view! The restaurant and bar/lounge were very good but we usually ate elsewhere (depends on your taste and schedule).

It is near to Times Square, Penn Station and the Port Authority bus terminal. There are plenty of places to eat close by and there is something for every palate. On Saturdays during the summer there is a farmer’s market just around the corner on 43rd Street. The breakfast in Yotel is not good. It is very overpriced and tea/coffee is charged for separately. Be very careful when if you are booking your hotel as you may be charged for facilities when you check in. In our case this charge was an extra $43 per night. We stayed 5 nights so this was a very expensive extra charge. This charge is meant to cover your Wi-Fi, smart tv and ice machines etc. The smart tv in our room was not working and it took 3 days to get it fixed. There is meant to be ice available on every floor and it is only available on some. The bathroom/toilet is separated from the bedroom only by the shower glass.

When calling customers at to why the reason being is they never got a reservation email in order to cancel a booking.

 I used Bookatable to make a post-theatre reservation at a restaurant in the knowledge that there would be few restaurants open and I'd be very pushed for time to find one after the show.
 Imagine my irritation when the booking was cancelled by the restaurant only hours before I was due to eat there. The irritation turned to annoyance when follow-up enquiries that I made in the following days established that the restaurant didn't even open that late and never had done! 
 Apparently the system that Bookatable employ is only verified with the restaurant a matter of hours before guests are due to arrive. Thus, if mistakes of this nature are made there is no time left to remedy them. Good for Bookatable, no doubt, but also hopeless for anyone using their service.

But I was so wrong, the people were so friendly, the place was beautiful. Everything ran so so smoothly. I didn’t expect the included photographer to produce pictures as beautiful of the ones that arrived through the post at home in a gorgeous album four days later! After the ceremony we moved outside for photographs. Yes there were visitors around us but they stayed behind our invited group of guests. They clapped and cheered and wished us congratulations. We then walked over to place a padlock on the LOVE wall. This was followed by afternoon tea at Smiths Hotel. Yet again, this surpassed expectations the food was excellent. The staff were so attentive and being just 100 yards away from the blacksmith shop. It was perfectly  located for us all to park and meet. I couldn’t recommend that you get married at Gretna Green any more . I want to do it all over again 🤣 and even some of my guests have said they plan on coming back to renew their wedding there. Thank you so much to all of you who might read this who made our day so perfect."

Popular visitor attraction with hotel accommodation & shopping.","Decided to choose hotel for overnight stay for 18 year Wedding Anniversary as previous experiences were very good and checked reviews still good. First issue when we arrived was like wacky races trying to find parking space as there was a wedding on and they had more staff in than normal, common sense would say that as probably weddings on a weekly if not daily basis there would be a parking system in place with allocated spaces for wedding party guests, paying guests and also staff instead of a free for all, maybe if they had so many staff in someone should have been out there advising where to park as well. We then went to Reception and i was asked for a debit card for security fine but didn't inform me that they would take a £1 of my account not the amount but the principle and then instead of paying balance of booking when leaving we had to pay it when arriving never done that before also not informed that in order for lights etc to work we would need to put card in slot in wall in room. So we then got to room that is supposedly an easy access room for wheelchair users etc, the room was like an oven and only has double doors that open out to small pation area not very security concious, no fan in room either should be available without having to ask for it especially in the heat we have been having and the fact you can't leave the door open when not in room the room was also very small and claustraphobic. The food was ok i thought but when i returned home i was very unwell with upset stomach etc after breakfast i used the facilities and in the same toilet there was a staff member who left without washing their hands, have we not came out from a pandemic where it was mandatory to wash hands and cleanliness has that bee forgotten so important but regardless hand washing after toilet common sense. So disappointed will not return do not waste your hard earned money choose somewhere else."

We moesten erg lang op het hoofdgerecht wachten, waardoor we het idee kregen dat de drankrekening flink opgeschroefd moest worden. De jonge ober deed zijn best, maar moest nog wel een paar kneepjes in het vak leren (hij vroeg de hoofdgast steeds als laatste om zijn bestelling, lijkt mij niet de bedoeling).

Wished we had read Tripadvisor reviews first.I have added this para after the management reply. Drooling is the least concern; perhaps the dogs were leaving hook worm eggs on the seat for children to pick up? Or perhaps you tell children which part of the pub or lawns they cannot go in?  I note the Tripadvisor review where a customer trod in dog poo, inside the restaurant, during the month you say there were no dogs inside. Since when has 30August to 18th September been ""a month"". Customers will decide.I have added this para after the management amended their response claiming the dogs belonged to them - and not the elderly man who walked them in and was sat on the settee between them.

We were directed to a table next to one where there were dogs. We chose to sit elsewhere. When placing our order, two of the six items were unavailable. There were only diners at three other tables but we had a three quarters of an hour wait before our meal was served. My steak was tough and largely inedible, my husbands belly pork resembled thin rashers of streaky bacon and several of my daughters vegetables were burnt. On asking if our meals were ok and being told they were unsatisfactory, the waiter just replied he was sorry to hear that and made no effort to resolve the situation. We left without sampling the dessert menu. Cleanliness was also an issue: the table top was sticky as was the floor around the bar. My daughter visited the ladies toilets and said they were ‘dreadful’. The following day I responded to a survey emailed to me regarding my visit. I received an inappropriate and insulting response from the manager, for which I later received an apology, but to date I have had no response to the issues raised in the survey.

When we queried this with the waiter, he told us he had made the alcoholic version and it was our fault for not making it clearer we were ordering a virgin drink. Our whole table of four heard that we had ordered the virgin cocktail but he just completely dismissed these claims.

1,Strada,['Restaurant'],2.8,2015-12-17,priya,Highly NOT recommended,"Strada is all about great quality, simple, freshly prepared pizza, pasta and risotto served in a stylish contemporary surrounding.","My colleagues and I were at a company dinner party. Myself and 3 other colleagues went with a pasta dish and a pizza. 
The pasta was the creamy chicken which was absolutely horrible, it was burned and we tried to add more parmasan but the awful burned taste stayed in our mouth. 
 The pizza my colleague ordered, was simply a big round dough which had cheese, maybe 3 leafs of what looked like spinach and an egg. This is a insult to the italian cuisine. 
 We finally got two new seafood risotto to replace the awful burning pasta, and that was simply just the taste of water. They promised us 5-10 min waiting time to get the risotto, but in their mind that was 20 minutes. 
 The interior designing of the place is not even a cosy atmosphere as you sit and look into 4 walls decorated with a mirror to look at yourself. 
 Strada should not be charging those prices for meals that have no value."

I went with some workmates for a lunchtime meal as someone was leaving.

Two of the orders were wrong, but there was no time to send them back.  The food was OK – nothing to shout about though.  Service terrible though – we had to go to the till as the waitress didn’t bring the bill over, despite asking on several occasions.  Would not go again, and would not recommend."

We went in and were abruptly taken to our seats, the waitress swiftly went back towards the front entrance before I had a chance to ask where the toilets were.  We were seated in such a cramped, tight space.  The restaurant was not busy and we decided we wanted to move seats.  We were shouted at by the woman who directed us to our seats.  Everyone turned around, which was embarrassing for us. I then told her that we were uncomfortable where we were originally seated.  We then moved to another corner where waitresses where going back and forth serving customers .  If it weren't for the fact we were tired and hungry, we honestly would have walked out at this stage. When the bill came the waitress added service charge to our bill without asking us, she did remove this after we queried it. I have been here in the past and have been greeted in a courteous manner.  The customer is paying for this experience and service. Won't be going back here in a hurry !"

3,Strada,['Restaurant'],2.8,2023-09-05,Sukanya,Unethical Payment Practices,"Strada is all about great quality, simple, freshly prepared pizza, pasta and risotto served in a stylish contemporary surrounding.","I had dinner at Strada in Southbank this evening. The food was decent and the service was pleasant. My problem is the unethical manner of payment. There was a QR code on the table which said you can scan it to pay. I scanned it and it showed the bill along with an 'optional 12.5% service charge'. It isn't really optional as you have to specifically ask a member of staff to have this removed. That aside, the service was positive so I was happy to pay the SC. I went to pay my part of the bill (£14.50) plus SC which came to £16.32. However this is when it got dodgy. The website then asks you if you want to pay a 'tip' and it automatically had £2 selected as the 'tip'. I had to select £0 as the 'tip' in order to not pay the additional £2. Had I not noticed then I would have ended up paying the £2 as well as the legitimate SC.It is super shady to add a so called tip on top of SC and put the onus on the customer to deselect the £2 button. I can imagine alot of customers get caught out by this because you may think that the SC has not been added and go ahead and pay the extra money. What is the justification for this? What is the justification for requiring the customer to actively unselect a button when they are already paying the 12.5% SC? At the very least you must not have the £2 pre selected option. The customer needs to actively consent and understand what they are paying for, which means giving them the choice to add additional service charge if they feel it is warranted. By pre selecting an option, you are taking away the choice which is unfair and unethical. It is prejudicial to the customer and financially benefits the company. Given that £2 is a relatively small amount hardly any customers would bother to complain to the restaurant if they paid it without actually wanting to. Presumably that's the intention behind the practice, which is why it continues to operate."

Very empty at lunchtime. One of the worst house white wines we have tried in a long time, sour, nothing pleasant at all and pricey. The pizza bread was fine and tasty, my tricolore salad and spaghetti pomodoro were kiddy size portions  but apart from the size the taste was fine.The ravioli was a little better in size.I assume they have shut many of their restaurants as others don't like the value and vote with their feet, as we will now do.

","Can I start by saying that leaving such a negative review is not something I take any pleasure in whatsoever, but I feel i have to share my awful experience to forewarn others. So….having not heard back from 2 other restaurants re our works Christmas meal, I decided on San Marino’s (we had been last year for our Xmas meal, and despite one incident, it had been a relatively good night). I was asked to confirm numbers, pay a £10 deposit per person and told that the deposits would be deducted from the bill for those that attended, but if someone didn’t come, their deposit would be lost rather than go towards the bill. I called in advance to ensure they were open and was told I had to pay cash. All good so far…  I popped in after visiting a cashpoint, paid £80, received a receipt, and left. So we attended on Friday 23rd December; there were only 7 of us instead of the planned 8 due to sickness. We ordered, had truly beautiful food and were served by a lovely waitress. I left early, tired having been at work all day and left the deposit receipt and some extra cash for the bill with my work buddies. The next morning I received a call from one of them informing me that the restaurant didn’t ‘accept’ the deposit receipt and told my friends I hadn’t paid any deposit.. they claimed I had left my card details and unless they all paid the full amount they would bill my card instead. They felt bullied and scared for me being billed so paid and took all the receipts away. I honestly hope none of them thought what the restaurant said was true and that I hadn’t paid the deposit money they had given me. Basically San Marino’s told them I’d lied to them! I was furious. It was Christmas Eve, I thought everyone had had a wonderful night after working so very hard all year and now all of this!!! I went straight to the restaurant for some answers. I knocked on window as they were closed but I could see staff were there. A lady came to the door and I told her why I was there. I started by telling her I was very angry and explained what I had been told unfolded the previous evening. She did say she wasn’t there to be shouted at on Christmas Eve, to which I apologised but said that I also didn’t want to be there on Christmas Eve trying to sort all of this out (tbh I was proud of myself for not resorting to swearing considering the circumstances)!! The friend who called me sent me screenshots of the bill and my deposit receipt which I showed her. A man then came to the door and said it was him they spoke with last night. Remember I mentioned a previous incident last year.. this too related to this man.. he served me a meal I hadn’t ordered and insisted I’d made a mistake and wouldn’t change it.. I have extremely strict dietary needs and knew perfectly well what I had ordered and really didn’t appreciate being argued with about it! Ok… so he said my friends never showed him the receipt and if they would have, he would have deducted it from the bill accordingly. My friends have said they gave the receipt to the waitress who took it away.. he then returned with it and said I hadn’t paid despite it clearing saying in black and white I had. I don’t know who this man is..a manager, front of house, whatever.. he has caused a huge upset twice now, he had lied to my face and apparently was really rude on the night at the time. They gave me the deposit back in cash. They could never have billed my card as they never took the details insisting I paid cash! As for trying to say he hadn’t been shown the receipt, who do you think I’m going to believe.. him…some man who seems to want to cause drama, upset ppl and lie or an NHS specialist cancer nurse of 40 years that I work with day in day out and I am proud to call a dear friend??? So, yes I raised my voice, but I would like to think anyone could see why I was annoyed and I immediately apologised once it was pointed out… however, not a single apology did I receive from them! The food was amazing, the restaurant and atmosphere were fab.. sadly all of this was then ruined by the actions of one person. Shame on him! He knows who he is. If he’s in charge then I can’t begin to imagine how many complaints they must get, if he’s not, get him out! He will destroy the business with an attitude and lack of respect or regard for his customers that has been demonstrated to us!"

We ordered takeaway for 2 special chicken curry from Chennai Dosai in Birmingham and when delivered one chicken curry container accidently opened and the curry was in the carry bag. We contacted fusion kitchen and according to their customer service and delivery team the food was delivered. The driver who delivered indeed took a photo of the food in the carry bag and sent it to the fusion kitchen in front of us. Fusion kitchen is disputing this and saying the food was delivered. We contacted chennai dosai and they were happy to replace the ch iken curry provided FUSION kitchen send a driver to collect the food which the fusion kitchen won't do as in their view the food was delivered. We paid fusion kitchen extra £ for delivery. They won't sent a driver at any cost eventhough the restaurent was happy to replace the food.

I complained and was told to email Sean the Operations Manager. I emailed Sean asking if Panoramic 34 could cover my dry cleaning bill to try and salvage my coat. A few days later I received a very blunt response from Sean stating that they: ‘don’t accept any responsibility for a persons belongings when they are left in the cloakroom.’ and as a result they wouldn’t compensate me for my dry cleaning bill. He ended his email: ‘I am sure that is not what you wanted to hear but that is our policy.’ — Surely they have a duty of care when looking after a patron’s belongings?Afternoon tea was distinctly average and overpriced.

Sadly after spending over £100 for two for lunch each portion of the two course meal would fit in one  (separate) hand,  I appreciate it is mostly about the experience BUT for over £100 no one should leave hungry .

Lunch was great, fabulous view of Liverpool Bay, good service and the food was really nice. Moved into the bar and had a corner table with a poor view. In an hour we managed to get a coffee but nothing else. We had planned to stay for 2 hours but left after the appalling service received in the bar. Have been here before and this was a really disappointing end to our visit."

The food was okay. We both had pork cooked three ways followed by cheese and biscuits (£55 each excluding sides). We ordered cocktails on arrival, which didn’t turn up. I had to ask for it again after our starters arrived. We also ordered a glass of English sparkling wine, and a bottle of Cabinet Sauvignon. Not once did our waiter pour any wine. It was left for me to pour it myself (never had to do that before). Final bill £241.34 for the two of us. I’d like to say something positive about our experience, but sadly I can’t."

Napkins on the table which we had to undo ourselves, and pour our own wine and waterWe were given 3 menus, à la carte, lunch menu and tasting menu, we were told order from any menu but we both had to eat from the same menu,  the tasting menu would take over 3 hours and would be too long for the time they were open.    We ate from the à la carte menu, we ordered langoustine with ravioli and king scallop, the ravioli pasta was as tough as old boots and rubbery no filling in one at all, I told the waitress and she said it was meant to be al dente, I showed her how rubbery it was, she took it away and offered another starter which I declined.     Both had Dover Sole as a main course, this was rolled in breadcrumbs and deep fried with mash potato, it was like a deconstructed fish pie, tasted OK but nothing to rave about.    We decided not to have anything else as we were both unimpressed we paid the bill and the 10% service charge and also were charged for the rubbery starter.   We won’t be going back"

Seated by the till at a low brown coffee formica table I was shocked to learn that this was indeed our table - not set ready waiting for our arrival and not the window seat as discussed during a courtesycall from the restaurant the day before. I paid £200 for 5 afternoon teas, with a drink each and 10% service charge - booked weeks in advance.I'd seen the online menu so with these prices I expected the service and the ambiance.After the staff handed over their shift to one another, the joys of being in the area of the till and as the pop music blared out the speakers, so the long awaited drinks at £10 each came out - and at the same time as the food. We had no opportunity to toast our celebration and enjoy the drinks.Instead we had to juggle them whilst a continual barrage of crockery came our way onto a table not fit for purpose - 5 side plates, a cake stand, a plate of scones, 5 dessert pots, 5 tea pots and 5 cups and saucers... I think that was everything...oh 2 pots of jam and 2 pots of cream - and the cutlery, wrapped in a paper serviette, it doesn't come with a much cheaper feel than that. To top the disappointment I'd given  the staff some extra little cake decorations to personalise the afternoon tea with as it was a special surprise for one of our party - they didn't materialise.On the plus side our Tea - as it stewed while we had our drink - was free to refill and the food was good,"

Young lady directed us to our table and did all the faffing about as you’d expect, water, napkins placed upon our laps etc..the menus were then brought out by a gentleman who then told us what was and wasn’t available, we ordered drinks and they came glasses filled to the brim with ice, ordinarily i dont have ice in my drink but on this occasion just went with it, we decided on the food and our order was taken by another gentleman. Not too long of a wait and the first course came out, along with gratis warm bread roll and a knob of butter. Food was okay , would’t rave to be honest. Main course was delivered 20 mins after the starter..ordered dessert and another gentleman was stood there with our dessert on a tray waiting at least 10 minutes before bringing it to the table, by the time it got there the quenelle of sorbet was already melted, the creme had mixed into the crusty pastry so was soggy. After finishing our meal we asked for the bill only to find that they had already put a “10% optional service charge on top “ you could ask for this to be removed if you so wished, but who is actually going to ask for it to be removed??..and why did they not ask before the final bill was generated if we were opposed to it being added ?…all in all we were quite dissatisfied and disappointed. We shall not be booking again."

We asked for the pizza to not be spicy at all as the pizza will be for the child. They brought us a very spicy pizza.2. I brought a cheesecake with apricot (cake bought from Paul) ans I asked them to place the cake in the fridge until we will need it at the end. They didn't put the cake in the fridge, the cheesecake and apricots were nearly melting down.. Because of this, it was very hard to cut the cake in slices.. The taste changed as well, as they kept the cake outside and it was very warm..3. I brought in candels to be used on the top of the cake and I asked them to use all the candles.. They light 4 candles only because they were lazy and didn't care about my request.. I felt weird to see 4 candles on my cake..At the end because I asked about the remaining candles they brought back part of them..4. Bella Cosa added automatically on top of the bill their tips, eveb though the service was horrible.. Bringing our bill up to over GBP 200.5. We ordered 5 glasses of perenoni beer.. 2 of them came with some small solid bits that were quite at the end of the glass.. We asked them what is happening as the other glasses were ok. They said that they don't know.. We asked for the 2 glasses of beer to be replaced with 2 bottles of peroni. One bottle came in very fast and the other bottle didn't arrive at all.. I had to ask 3 times so that they can bring the 2nd beer.. One of my guests remained without drink quite a while.. Because of this incident.. If you see that something is not ok, you should apologise, and replace asap both of the glasses..6. We were not provided kids menu and we had to order big portions for the 2 little kids...7.

1,"Swan, Shakespeare's Globe",['Restaurant'],2.7,2023-06-03,Rod,Truly terrible food,,"I booked this for 12 people back in June and the food was truly terrible.   First we received hardly any of the side dishes that we had ordered. Secondly, most of the main courses were truly terrible from a culinary point of view - the chicken appeared to be some sort of reconstituted mush, rather than proper pieces of chicken and generally our entire party left unsatisfied with the standard of the food.  We did not let it spoil the occasion which was the meeting of two families for the first time ahead of a wedding, but it was a real disappointment to find that a restaurant in such a prestigious location could perform so badly food wise (the service was ok).  We have now had the wedding and I have been meaning to writing this review for some time.   I was also unhappy that booking via the intermediary (I think it was 'Design my Night' that had to be used as you could not book direct), had a checkbox for terms and condition that had to be completed but the page to view them was not available.  Think twice before you book this venue for a special occasion."

She told me to stop arguing!! i asked for another fresh pizza or a refund and she remarked it's because i cant pay!! even though i had already paid with my debit card an hour before. She left with my pizza-NO REFUND of £15.95!! I then had to call the store and was told by the Manager no refunds on on-line orders! Who's ever heard of that? You don't order from NEXT, Karen Millen or superdry etc on-line and don't get a refund if faulty,as my pizza so clearly was! Listen to there slogan guys_this will make you laugh!!

I ended up with a stone cold pizza re-delivered back to me in 3 minutes, so goes to show how cold it was before,even in it's special bag!

The app's user-friendly interface made it easy to set my preferences, including budget, occasion, preferred location.Three hours before my scheduled time, I received a notification that sent a thrill through me. The excitement of not knowing where we would be dining added an extra layer of adventure to the experience. When the time came, we arrived at the location and was blown away by the hidden gem we discovered.The restaurant chosen by Book Enigma perfectly matched my preferences and exceeded my expectation. It was a delightful surprise that I wouldn't have discovered on my own.Book Enigma's commitment to creating unique dining experiences is commendable.

The three restaurants i have mentioned in the title are of excellent quality, with both Maze and Hospital Road making it into my personal top ten of London restaurants. The food is both innovative and the service impeccable but friendly. I would highly recommend these restaurants to anyone for a special night out or just a mid week treat away from the children. 
My mother who is not so much of a foodie as myself but more a down to earth good honest food type loved Savoy Grill (not one of my personal favourites but there was certainly nothing wrong with it) and has raved about it ever since. It has beaten any 3* Michelin restaurant I have taken her to so it must be doing something right. Everything is down to personal taste at the end of the day.

The deactivation occurred days before I was to cash in my 9 x £50 off. £450 equivalent in yum. What was the point in being active and loyal since 2016 and earning yum so that I had saved £450 worth when the FORK deactivated my account based on 2 NO SHOWS in 365 days?"

It cost £6k.  During the 4 month of preparations, 4 senior staff members left.  When we arrived on the morning of the party, the floors were sticky, there was no running water in the loos upstairs (a slight trickle and not enough to wash hands) and over 20 of our guests, including myself and young children, are suffering from bad stomachs.  We are in the process of collecting samples to test for food poisoning.  And for the pleasure, they are now asking for an extra £350 cleaning bill!  This was not stipulated in the contract so we will also be seeking legal advice about this too.  Greg the new manager is a pleasant guy, but overall we are extremely disappointed with the experience and do not recommend you hire out this venue, or even go for drinks etc if you want good sanitisation and not to be poisoned by the food they make."
