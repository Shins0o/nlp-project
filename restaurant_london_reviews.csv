1,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2024-01-13,Sima Nava,Rude and unfair treatment,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"The waiter was terribly rude, I visited here on 13th of January at 1pm with my party, and unfortunately, our experience was less than satisfactory. Upon arrival the waiter told us that all tables were booked and left us waiting in the cold for about half an hour.To our surprise, another group arrived without a reservation (we overheard them) during our wait, and the waiter promptly seated them. I went in and confronted him and the other party admitted that they didn't have a reservation and then they left! We felt deceived and frustrated, especially given the presence of a child in our group and the freezing weather.Obviously we also left, and went to one of the other several restaurants in East Dulwich...I really think the management need to review the booking system and the professionalism of their staff as what we experienced this weekend was just awful."
2,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2024-01-13,Aidy,Appalling service from staff at Exeter branch.,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Took my girlfriend to Franco Manca Exeter branch for a birthday treat. I really wish I had gone somewhere else now.Food was good however, the customer service was appalling. After waiting a long time to be seated, we made our order. For some reason, they served our main course before the starters? When it was pointed out that we wished for starters first, staff seemed startled by this request. How can they get this so wrong? Their own menu even mentions starters as ""pre pizza""? No apology from staff for this.Among others, the starters included Beef Ragu with bread (included). Unfortunately  the bread was not served and we had to ask for it. Things feeling awkward now and once again, no apology from the staff who seemed a bit stumped by us simply asking for what we had ordered.Pizzas came out after a long time waiting. Waiting to pay the bill took far too long as well.Overall, the food was good but the service was appalling. The waiting staff seem disinterested in their jobs and going by the glum look on their faces, probably don't want to work there. It was difficult attracting their attention for the things described above. No one even asked us if everything was OK with our meal.Took my girlfriend there hoping for a nice time and walked out feeling worse. Paid the bill and at least they had the decency not to include the service charge.  Doubt I'll ever go back again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

Started off with one of our party who was deaf and did not hear the waiter being castigated for not acknowledging the staff, poor man stated he never heard the waiter talking to him at all.Waiter then said he did not need to write down the order as he could remember and subsequently order came to table incorrectly. We tried to rectify but staff were busy elsewhere, (one on a smoke break)!Food was not great, soggy watery pizza, not great at all. We had also ordered one pizza for takeaway which was ordered at the beginning of the meal and to to our amazement when we got home we had an empty box instead of a pizza, I think there was a miscommunication and this was laughable! Awful service, awful pizza, awful experience.  Real sense of an unmotivated staff, ( and that is a kind way of putting it)! Avoid at all costs, they will never see a penny of mine again!"

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Clearly the last thing the Bournemouth square branch needed was more eat in diners the evening we went there. One waiter was attempting to cover what seemed like the whole restaurant. To his credit he remained cheerful and professional but he was swimming against the tide. The jug of water he offered to get for us never materialised. We did eventually manage to get a couple of pizzas which were underwhelming to say the least. Mine -the vegan special of the day- was so spicey as to be almost inedible. All in all, a less than satisfactory experience."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,I ordered gluten free pizza from this store and they accidentally made me a normal pizza containing gluten. I'd eaten some of it before questioning and then they confirmed they'd made a mistake. I was on a strict gluten free diet post gut surgery and ended up in a lot of pain for 24 hours plus it was a very scary experience. The restaurant didn't even offer a refund of the food. They investigated and admitted the mistake but said all their procedures were fine as it was the fault of the ticket system! They really don't seem to understand the importance of getting it right when it comes to allergies or contraindications. Thankfully I had no long-term issues but they could kill someone with this attitude.

Staff very polite and helpful but tables are tiny, not enough room for plates and glasses, let alone dips or oil bottles etc. The huge pizza crust forms about 5cm of the perimeter of the pizza, so only the middle of the pizza has any topping! For us it was far to soggy underneath (I like sourdough but this was stodgy) and the large crust was heavy to consume. The toppings weren't well or evenly constructed and not much flavour either. Sadly a disappointment all round and likely won't be re visiting. After reading the reviews post our experience, I see some people have quoted 'best pizza' in their review??? Maybe other branches are better? We politely informed our waitress of our constructive criticism and she was very polite and professional in her response."

Went to Trafford Centre branch. Order tomato, mozzarella and basil pizza which arrived without the basil. Taste was average. My friends flatbread was dry and had stale rocket on it. When complained about it we got 10% knocked off the bill but this was just the service charge that they add on without your permission. Not sure what service charge they can justify taking, not once did we get asked how the meal was or if we needed anything. Our waiter seemed to be unhygienic which was off-putting from the start.

He could not care less and treated me like I was complaining about a wrong order or cold food.

Errors were made in delivering our pizzas to our table.After much conversation with the waitress that we really did not order the pizzas she trying to persuade us to accept, we were given the correct order.After a friend paid the bill, we realised that we were also charged for the incorrect pizzas and an 'optional!' service was added too.We spoke with the manageress asking for a refund of the pizzas we didn't order and didn't eat. She said, ""It's your mistake and you should have checked your bill before you paid!""After much insisting, she said that she couldn't refund any money and that we should write to head office. No apology was given. Sooooo disappointing. Terrible manner from their manager Rachele who said their mistake is our mistake.She eventually filled in a refund form and said she'd send it off.Reading reviews, it seems that others have also been told no refunds are given. We do not have any hope for receiving money 'taken' from us.I suggest that mangers are taught to apologise and try and be kind and helpful rather than switching the blame. Was also rather off-putting to have person making pizzas wearing trousers and underpants falling from bottom, exposed two inches of it! Nice food cannot make up for terrible service!

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,Great experience today at the Franco Manca in Ealing. We were there for celebrating my friend birthday . We were a big group with 5 kids and staff was amazing and very friendly. The person who served us diserve 5 stars for the customer service skills. He was frequently checking on us if we were needing anything and updating us about the waiting time for the drinks and pizzas which was very fast. I gave them 4 starts instead of 5 because I brought an ice cream cake and instead of putting it in the freezer they put it in the fridge because they did not have space and it was not in the original condition and almost melted when we had it.

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I ordered a pizza which was not well cooked at all. The ingredients were thrown on top into chunks which didnt melt even when I popped it in the oven as recommended. The pizza had far too much N'duja, which was not nicely distributed. The pizza had far too much oil and the mozzarella was dry. This is not the first time I've been disappointed by Franco Manca - often I have had to order extra amounts of basic ingredients (such as tomato sauce& mozzarella) to make it taste as  a good pizza should. I don't think I'll be spending another 15 pounds on a pizza which does not meet basic expectations."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Poor quality and not worth the price for what you get compared to other pizzerias I've been to. The burrata was cheap and not runny, the nduja cheap and the dish tasted oddly sweet. The pizza with wild mushrooms, ham and little tomato didn't look appetising and tasted worse than Domino's pizza. Also hated the fact there was no tomato base for it just tomato sauce slammed on top of the really cheap undercooked ingredients. The service was fairly quick although the staff looked exhausted. The atmosphere was nice but the music was way too loud I couldn't talk to my parent well. I am glad the manager told us it was on a house because I wouldn't have honestly paid for such poor quality food that was also rather expensive for what it is worth."

I had mine delivered by ubereats and it was also cold, so I'd obviously been the last of the line with it being delivered on a bike.  I left feedback, but they do not show it and or bother to come back to you, so they will fail as a business, which is sad. This is not value for money. it's worth a fiver not 15 delivered and you'll require 2 to be half satisfied if you are not on a diet"

When the food arrived it was cold, lacked any flavour and was quite possibly the worst margarita I have ever eaten which is odd as im not sure how you can mess up a margarita when thats your speciality!

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"The pizzas were good and reasonable value. Staff seemed overstretched but our waiter did everything he could to give us a good experience (thank you L).When we had finished I asked if I could give a card tip as I had no cash on me.L told me not to bother because the waiting staff do not get these tips. I had no idea that this was the case and have found out since that only cash tips might get to the staff. This seems very unfair especially as I had previously paid card tips in good faith, expecting them to go to the waiting staff. I don't think many people know this - and probably Franco Manca is not the only restaurant doing this.It all feels a bit dishonest for a brand that sells itself as a zippy, modern company.It will deter me from going again, knowing that the hard-working staff might be being ripped off.Readers: Ask your server what happens to tips and service charges before you pay."

This is an issue in the hospitality sector and it is sad that Mr Nabil Mankarious and his team are not willing to see this and provide help where it matters. Mr M.. you can either bury your head in your latest results (pat on the back!) and assume the next quarter is the same...and lose your business...or you can help your staff to understand the issues and help out. There is a lot YOU can do. Get out of your ivory tower.Your assets...your staff and customers,  without either you have no business.It was my 1st time and last time at Franco Manca.

Back on May 2021 I decide to take my son out for the day, no-holds bard fun fun fun, we went all-over London or at least what we could fit in.  During the day and as always, you will get peckish and in my sons case bloody hungry, he's stomach on legs.  Any how, as it happened, whilst starting to get that desperate feeling as not knowing where to go for lunch, we were standing outside Franco's.  Right place at the right time.  As we approached the door, we were greeted very courteously & professionally, asked to sanitise hands, scan check-in, then we were seated by the window.  We were handed menu's, ordered drinks, told about the specials etc, nothing new, just great service.  The cheerful guy that served us was extremely good at his job, despite giving some tip that might help him in the future, went by the name 'Luciano'.  Honestly no one could ask for better in how someone could look after their customers.  Having struck conversation with Luciano, just made the whole lunch more worthwhile.  Feeling pretty tired going into the restaurant, its amazing how conversation and a giggle can revitalise guests to crack on and have a great afternoon.  So, YES, my son and I will be going back to Franco Manca's, soon hopefully, food was extremely good, service was exceptional, but Luciano, just made the experience that much better.  Mainly its because having been in lock-down for SO long, just great to talk with another human being."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"After going to Franco Manca in London a few times I was excited to hear it was coming to Chichester. I was however very disappointed with my experience (which I really hope is just teething problems being newly open). We waited 45 minutes for a table which is understandable with it being new and exciting. But soon after we were seated we had our drinks order taken - these never arrived until our starters were served 25 minutes later. The starters were very pleasant, no issues at all. When our main courses arrived, our pizzas were very soggy - it looked like a glass of water was poured over it. I tried eating a slice but it made me nauseous and could not eat more. When the waitress came over she apologised but told me it‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be when made when with buffalo mozzarella - which I‚Äôve never seen this wet before. The base was undercooked and soaked. I‚Äôve had great experiences in Franco Manca before, it‚Äôs just a shame that this experience was very poor. I noticed other tables being left unattended and had conversations with other customers who also never received their drinks. We had 3 different waiting staff attend to us so it was clear no one had delegated sections, and no one was focused on drink orders as it was a bit all over the place.I hope they take all feedback on board and can improve their service and dining experience over all as it is generally a good restaurant chain and I‚Äôd like to give benefit of the doubt regarding this experience."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Franco Manca has always been a to-go-to place for pizza cravings around London, and we had exactly that on Sunday 15th Aug after visiting V&A next door.The restaurant was nowhere near full, but we were pointed to a mini table near the kitchen and given a judgemental look when suggesting a 4-seater (many of which were available). We are both 6ft tall and leg space is always appreciated, but of course we would move if larger parties were to come in afterwards. Noone expects a 5* service (just a delicious pizza served with a smile, thank you!), but interactions with the staff were rather unpleasant - it felt like the place was run by teenage girls with no supervision or customer service training. The order arrived quickly, but no-one checked on us throughout dinner and eye contact attempts were proficiently ignored. We ran out of water and could not order anything else as the waitress simply brushed by the table collecting empty glasses/bottle without asking if refill is needed. The bill arrived incorrect and instead of explaining the error proactively, the girl waited for it to be questioned - again, no customer service skills whatsoever (where a simple sincere apology would have done the trick). We paid and left without placing any complaints as this would have been simply pointless and would make the experience even more bitter.All in all - although hospitality is going through a rough time - please train your staff better, service is still about quality not quantity. A smile, as such, costs nothing - even post-pandemic!"

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,My fiance and I used to visit regularly before lockdowns and the service and food used to be great. We went to visit again once restaurants re opened and the service and quality of food and portions is terrible. 1) We first ordered a side of olives and only got 5 pieces in the little bowl. Usually the fill the bowl up. 2) We then ordered a side of mozzarella and garlic bread (which is the same price as the pizza) and we barely had any mozzarella on the bread. It was also luke warm when it arrived to the table and not hot like their pizzas and food usually is. 3) the two waitresses were just lazy and looked like they didn't even want to be there or do their job. 4) pizzas arrived luke warm and not straight away from the oven like they normally used to do. And it wasn't even the right order after making us wait 15+ minutes for food. Will not be visiting this branch again. Service and quality has gone down the drain massively. There's no excuse for food to come out warm instead of fresh!

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"Hello, I have visited Franco Manco restaurant in South Kensington with my mum on the 22nd July 2023 around 5pm. We had a pizza with a tiramisu and drinks. I don‚Äôt always look at the bill but I‚Äôm glad I did as they charged us 2 extra items which counted for 30% of the bill value. When I told the staff member, there was no apology and we were told that we have to fill in a form for a refund as this is the policy and then wait up to 5 days for the money to be refunded. My mum was not happy as this has never happened, money is normally refunded straight to the card, especially when this was not our fault - they put random items (extra ice cream and tiramisu) on our bill. When we filled in the form, I asked if there in any proof they can provide and the member of staff just smiled at me that this is a billion dollar company and they refund every customer. I believe this was a manger as the lady was dressed differently; not in uniform, with dark hair. It was not the person who asked for our order. Until today - 3rd of August, the refund was not received. I am very disappointed with the service and basically being robbed. Thanks a was a visit of my mum in London and we never came across situation like this in a restaurant. I have also emailed Franco Manco via their website and have not received any response. I would like to know how I can received this money back and how is this possible to happen in a big chain like this. This is only ¬£10 pounds but as I mentioned it is 30% of the bill, the service provided was horrible, and we have never been refunded. My mum is not from London so she has no way even going back to the restaurant, it is additional time and money and it has been inconvenient enough to deal with this situation. Very disappointing!Unfortunately I don‚Äôt see the option to upload attachments to upload the receipts."

1,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2023-10-24,Chris Welsh,Very sad to see another poor customer service experience. Why,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"We discovered Franco Manca in august, Southampton branch. It was the only restaurant with a table in the area and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. We thought the sourdough pizza was a bit chewing good texture and red wine in a tumbler? The menu is only pizza and some odd topping choices but hey Ho we were hungry. So when we recently were in london, the Aldwych branch popped up as a pre theatre option and we figured okay let‚Äôs go! We booked a table for 5:30 and arrived bang on time. On arrival the guy who checked us in frankly couldn‚Äôt really be bothered. They were clearly busy, but there is no need to make your ‚Äòguests‚Äô feel like they don‚Äôt want you to be there. There was no table, He said can you sit over there at the bar. In any other restaurant I have ever been to this means we will hold you here until a table is free but no, the bar here is four seats next to each other to eat. Not an ideal family meal out. Families came in after us and we‚Äôre show to a table of four. So what is the point of booking a table? We were given no choice but we English don‚Äôt want to kick up a fuss and nor do I want to do so on a family night out with our young Son. The food was poor all the toppings were literally thrown into the middle of the pizza so most of the pizza is just dough and a bit of cheese at best. Wine in a tumbler. Rustic some might say. Okay but just no better than a cheap takeaway in the street. When we came to pay they had added a service charge said optional and make no mistake I always reward good service but the guy who we met and who did most of the servicing was poor communication and just did not gel with his customers so I asked for the service charge to be removed. They then all went into a huddle and giving us the eye making us feel uncomfortable. He asked why and I told him why and he said we are having a very busy night. Sorry but that‚Äôs no excuse for not caring and making customers feel like they have had a service. If your not in a rush and just want a cafe pizza indoors but no engagement from the staff and happy without a restaurant experience but pay restaurant prices then okay but we won‚Äôt be going again. Looking at overall reviews another soon to be victim of nice try but failed. You‚Äôd think a company of this size would listen to its customers and get the staff and n basic customer service courses. With a 2.7 rating something can be done about it as statistically over time this has slowly been dropping."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"I popped into the Richmond branch at around 5pm on Thursday 30th September to discuss holding my 3-year old's birthday party in the basement. I took a table until a member of staff was available to show me the event hire area. I went to fetch a high chair for my 11-month-old who was in her pushchair. As I crossed the room my baby started crying. A woman customer sitting with a man at a table nearby asked to be moved and gave me a dirty look which made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Seeing the staff were busy and now feeling unable to relax, I decided to leave and return another time. The waitress helped me to the door and then as I was leaving the woman customer with absolutely no provocation whatsoever stuck her middle finger up at me. The waitress also witnessed this vile and rude gesture. I was extremely upset, flabbergasted and at a complete loss to understand what had just happened. I responded to the woman that she had no right to treat me like that especially as I was leaving the premises because she had made me so uncomfortable. At this point, the woman customer leapt from her seat and began to scream at me in an aggressive and frightening manner. At this point I was completely overwhelmed and felt faint. The young waitress helped me to the ground and I was shaking. The woman continued to scream at me. It was clear she had completely lost all self-control. The woman‚Äôs behaviour was totally disproportionate to the small amount of noise my children had made. I felt frightened and intimidated at this outburst. To make matters worse my three-year-old started crying because she too was frightened and upset I had collapsed. She couldn‚Äôt understand why this woman was screaming at us. This was a very upsetting incident for my children to witness. The female staff member (who I think was called Danielle) was incredibly kind and was obviously shocked herself. She soothed the children and gave us apple juice. She offered for us to stay and was very clear we had every right to be there, which of course we did. However, I did not feel safe with this woman in the same restaurant and didn‚Äôt want my children around someone who had such a short temper and whose behaviour was clearly unpredictable.My complaint is that whilst the young staff member was extremely kind and caring, a senior member of staff should have stepped in to deal with this. To allow a customer to use what is probably the most aggressive and offensive gesture towards me -  completely unprovoked - in what I thought was a family-friendly restaurant with no repercussions or consequences is totally unacceptable and outrageous. I no longer feel that Franco Manca is a safe environment for women, girls or young children.I emailed a complaint to the management of Franco Manca and received a woefully inadequate response which did not deal with the intimidation or the offensive gesture used. It was purely perfunctory. So be clear, Franco Manca allows its customers to be verbally abused, bullied and intimidated and the perpetrator is welcome to stay at the restaurant and the victim needs to leave to feel safe. Management conceded in their email that they had no official policy to deal with such incidents which I found staggering.  Of course the venue now will not be used for my daughter's birthday party, nor we will ever visit any branch of Franco Manca again. It's clearly not a safe family environment. Shame on you, Franco Manca."

Well-priced food, and the olives are to die for. I've ate at Putney, Richmond, Wimbledon, Battersea, and both the Westfields branches, and the dining experience has been superb at every one. The only one that didn't quite meet the same standards as the others was Cambridge, but it was during Eat Out to Help Out so I assume this could be down to the current restrictions when eating out, and how busy it was.

I wanted meat pizza so I ask the waiter if I could order meat pizza but leave half of it without the meat so half would be margarita. The waiter looked at me like I came from a different planet as said to me ""we don't do that in Italy"", he offered me a large pizza and a kids menu even after I said we don't want that. I reminded the guy that we are in London not Italy and that not putting ingredients on half pizza was very reasonable. I was denied the service so I left.

We didnt wait long despite being busy like every restaurant at the moment. Great service for sure, very friendly waiter and the food was ready quickly. Pity the Pizzas were not as expected. The locals rave about Franco Manca but I think this is restaurant snobbery. I've had way better in Zizzis or even Pizza Hut. The ingredients are fresh for sure and the dough too, but it was way too thin at the middle and undercooked at the edge. The ingredients were just thrown onto the middle and hardly a sprinkle of them. This meant one pizza had one satisfying mouthful and 10 'meh' ones. Disappointing for one who actually appreciates food and not just the hype of ""ooh lets go to Franco Manca, they make their own sourdough'"

Not at Franco Manca. My pizza arrived completely undercooked  and doughy. I sent it back and they made a fresh one. That came back in exactly the same state. Maybe it‚Äôs how they‚Äôre meant to be and I‚Äôm in the wrong expecting a crisp base. The only way to eat the pizza is with a knife and fork or to roll it up. Picking up a slice is not an option as the dough has no structural integrity. Besides the dough being barely edible the toppings, which were very sparse were also dreadful. Half cooked, greasy saut√© potatoes anyone? We had 8 pizzas between us. Every single one was undercooked and yet the crusts were brown. Which makes you think that the oven is simply not up to the job. We also had a bottle of house red - this was completely undrinkable and had to go back, not because it was corked, it was just dreadful quality wine."

They do not respect food preferences or alllergies apparently  etc.The pizza was uncooked and very badly presented. Only one small part had onions that i was charged 1 pound extra. Never saw or tasted the mushrooms. probably they are invisible mushrooms from the secret forest.I believe their clients are mainly tourists that they will leave the country in few days."

The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"We've been going to Franco Manca in Stoke Newington for years and recently the standard has dropped significantly. The waitresses are nice but the new manager has got a very bad attitude. He prances about doing the splits and craves attention. We just wanted a quiet meal and did not want to nurse his ego so he was rude, added items to the bill that we didn't order then kept us waiting while he pranced around some more annoying other customers. He kept throwing the bill at me and he's lucky we didn't just walk out. To make matters worse, the pizzas were smaller than before and burnt. We went here last week and the dough was raw making us ill the next day. If there was less of a circus act going on during the service, the pizzas would be better. Sorry but you have lost two customers, we're going elsewhere from now on."

Nothing.Nearly 4 years after, I recieve an email again threatening legal action for costs they enforced on me and sent my original signed contract with a fraudulant addition copy of their 'terms and conditions' that I had never seen before stating that they can change terms of agreement at any time and give the user a 6 week period to confirm or disagree. Never had these terms when I signed plus never had any correspondance off them at any point when my time lag was changed. They now have the audacity to chase me when THEY breached my contract.

I redeemed my points for cashback and was fine initially. Then they asked me recently after a couple of months unrelated to the points I waa redeeming to provide proof of the reservation attendance before they pay me cashback. Well I don't keep a receipt for drinks and food that I buy for a couple of months and I paid by cash so I don't have proof other than the restaurant confirming the booking and attendance as its asks for a review. They basically said to me if you can't provide proof by either a receipt or bank statement they will close my account and cancel all payments. The confirmation of reservation wasn't sufficient proof?Bit of a scam and joke of a company as they pay after 14 working days and forget to pay so when you request the 14 working days starts all over again? Would not recommend.

Alas, after 2 & 1/2 months they changed it and have refused to remove it.  The reason why we wanted to move away from Quandoo is because they have still to this day refused to put in our cut-off reservation times.  Meaning a customers can simply book a table 5 minutes before arrival and get a confirmed booking even though the restaurant is fully booked !!!We pay Google to promote our venue and Quandoo steals them from us.  They need to concentrate on building their own following and not adding their reservation link to our Business page.  Why Google allows this to happen I have no idea."

At the time I tried to find a nearby restaurant to use them in but all the ones listed on the app turned out to be no longer part of the scheme. My mother was terminally ill at the time and on 28th June I contacted Quandoo to tell them that I would struggle to be able to redeem my points because of the lack of outlets to use them in and the fact my family and I were spending most of our time at my mum‚Äôs bedside and asking if I would be able to receive an extension of the deadline under the circumstances. I received a reply on 30th June from Quandoo to say they have reached out to the appropriate department and they would be in touch. I heard nothing more and sent them a follow up email on 7th July asking them if they had any updates and also informing them that my mother had subsequently passed away. Today, 13th July, I received an email telling me my points had expired. I feel I did everything I could to try to resolve this situation and was upfront and honest with them yet all I received in turn was a total lack of empathy and common sense as well as very poor customer service."

In shock we phoned the support line asking what had happened and they told us that the headquarters in Berlin had by mistake put us in Tier 3 and without any correspondence just cancelled all our bookings. By the way, we are in Tier 2,just to set the record straight.I then tried to contact our area manager via WhatsApp and was blatantly ignored, followed by 'you should call the support team, I am not support'!!! WOW!! What a company this is!!??? I rang Berlin (I was brought up in Germany) to then been told that it was the UK head quarter that was at fault!!After the bookings were put back on our system, I asked our area manager Lisa to quickly send out an email to our guests to explain that their table had not been Cancelled and she said that they would do it tomorrow. OMG!!!Tonight we had two tables not showing up!Of course we rang our guests, but we could not reach all. The owner of our business did not receive any correspondence from Quandoo, no apology NOTHING !!!We are fighting through these very hard times and Quandoo choose to ignore this fatal mistake to our business!!

What a feast.  The beef was sublime and cooked perfectly medium rare (but had to go by internal temp rather than time). The veggies were perfect and the roast potatoes pretty good (not as good as home made but due to prep methods needed for ambient temp delivery were OK). The gravy with added bone marrow was nothing short of awesome.   Afters were sticky toffee pudding, toffe sauce and clotted cream which went down a treat.  Portion size for two was very generous and would probably feed three at a push.  If you can't get to their restaurants then this is the next best thing."

All the ingredients were of high quality and our house smelt amazing as we cooked the ingredients, our neighbour's cat jumped through our kitchen window to try get some!

However I was happily surprised. The time consuming elements like sauces and sides are all ready prepared and taste fabulous, super easy to heat up.

All 3 steaks were very poor, I presume these are the same steaks as available via Hawksmoor direct. The Porterhouse has more bone , a thick layer of fat and gristle than meat. I will struggle to feed 1 person with a 1Kg steak.The ribeye has loads of fat and gristle and doesn't look at all appetising or indeed a prime steak.The fillet is a long tail end and not as described a centre cut.I am very disappointed and angry about these steaks as I bought as a special treat and I am reluctant to use them as I fear the worst.Following this review I have had further communication from Alex at Hawksmoor and the matter has been very satisfactorily resolved. I am very happy to hear that they take the issue of steak quality very seriously and that this was probably a one off issue."

I emailed them within half an hour of making the booking, and they promised to cancel and refund my card. When Valentine's Day arrived, so did the (very expensive) box as they had failed to cancel the order. We decided to keep the box and not request a refund, but did let the restaurant know that they had failed to cancel the order. There was no reply, even after my follow up requesting the General Manager's contact details. So: 3* rating for poor service. The food was superb though - steak was divine, chips were excellent and very similar to the restaurant. Don't expect them to get back to you though if you order."

Lovely corner table ready for us. Impeccable service, waited on hand and foot by our lovely waiter Alex. Then, unfortunately, the gutter decided to spit out some cretins who decided to sit next to us on a 6 person table, only to squeeze in additional guests later on. One particular individual produced his BYOB from his pocket and proceeded to pour into the glass on the table! The conversation was delightful, full of stories of how he had been called to court on a murder charge and F this and C that. Delightful. (I hope you're reading this by the way....).Grace, the Manager handled the situation beautifully and couldn't have been more apologetic. Sending over complimentary drinks and desserts.Couldn't recommend enough.To the absolute troglodyte who thought spending a lot of money meant you could do as you wished......remember, you can have all the money in the world, but it won't buy you class!To end, I would recommend the Hawksmoor, not just for the food, but also the service. Just a shame my boyfriends first experience was tainted somewhat but the party of utter twonks next to us."
1,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2021-09-18,Jennifer Walker,Not fit for purpose,,"Unfortunately the packaging and delivery service (via DPD) is not fit for purpose. I have now had 3 failed attempts at a delivery of a single order (2 didn't make it past DPD depot and one that was delivered with wine pouring out of it on my doorstep). The customer service team are great are organising a replacement box (but it just won't actually get to you) and listening to feedback about the issues, but it evidently isn't taken on board as this morning's notification from DPD that my box was on its way back to Hawksmoor illustrates. A great shame, but 3 failed deliveries out of 3 attempts isn't a fluke. If you get your food, it will be lovely, but just bear in mind that there is a significant risk of the delivery not actually being made."

Best roast beef dinner I've ever had, and, as I said to Tristan by email, as I'm 69 I've had quite a few!!We had a good ""blow out"" with substantial helpings. There was quite a bit of beef left over which went into cold beef sandwiches for Monday lunch (yum), and still a bit left for Tuesday! Quite a bit of veg left over, which, with a little top up, will become bubble and squeak for Monday dinner with sausages.  The red wine and champagne was very good too (not much of that left over!). Highly recommended üòÅ"

We actually ate it over 2 nights as we didn‚Äôt think we would be able to eat the ribs as a starter without spoiling the main course a bit. I‚Äôm really glad we did as the ribs and slaw were amazing so we had 2 dinners! The cocktails were lovely and I drank mine whilst cooking. Maybe that‚Äôs why I was so relaxed. The red wine stretched over both nights.It is all so easy to cook so no worries there.I nearly forgot the sticky toffee pudding. Simply the best pudding we‚Äôve had in a long, long time."

2,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2022-08-06,Pada Kay,Appalling service.,,"This was meant to be a pleasant experience. My daughter had just submitted her course work after having slogged away at it for weeks. We decided to celebrate on that Friday and so she booked a table at a restaurant. She then texted me back to say that she had changed the booking and booked it at Hawksmoor instead as she preferred to go there. We had been there quite a few times before and had liked it a lot. We arrived for 8 and were shown to our table. It was very busy, and the tables were packed closely together, so much so I could not get into my seat. I also accidentally knocked off the jacket of the lady seated behind me. I therefore asked to be seated at the next table and was kindly allowed to change the table. We ordered our drinks and starters and by the time we got them it was well past 8:30. When we finished the plates were removed and we waited for the main course. It was more than 35 minutes before we even got a chance to speak to a waiter. In the mean while the couple to my right who were in the middle of their starters when we arrived had finished their main course and had paid their bill and left. They were soon followed by another couple who were well into their starters and we still had not got our main course. The man and his son to my left who were seated after we had arrived had also finished their starter and their main course and paid and left. This was very frustrating to watch. We enquired as to what was happening about the time it was taking as both tables on either side had left. We were told that we were third in the queue. This really annoyed me. How could we be third when other people on tables nearby who had come after us had finished and left. When I questioned that, I was told something about temperatures. All the tables around me had ordered a steak like us and I asked how long it takes to make a steak and a burger and why was it longer than the tables on either side of us. They then came back and asked whether we wanted to eat or pay the bill and cancel the meal. This at a quarter to ten when we would not be able to go anywhere else to eat. We decided to eat any way and the meal was subsequently brought to us. The bun of the burger was burnt and to add insult to injury there was a plastic bit in the burger. By this time we had lost our appetite and any desire to eat. I was asked how the meal was!!. Waiter/manager said this was not a place to have this conversation and they would email us!! We asked the remainder of the steak to be packed for my dogs. Waiter came and brought the bag and offered us a box of chocolates which was a nice enough gesture but was not satisfactory at all. Our whole evening was ruined and what was meant to be an enjoyable meal was a disaster. The service was appalling, and I was deeply disappointed. In all fairness the steak was soft and cooked to perfection when I cut it up for the dogs later. The food has always been good in the Knightsbridge branch of Hawksmoor. Shame we could not enjoy the food due to the abysmal service. I regret to say I shall not be coming to Hawksmoor or be recommending it for some time to come."

I called them and they apologised and promised my next main would be free on a subsequent order. This evening I have called them to claim that main dish and been told the following:1. They can send the main dish and my side dish of singapore noodles but because it's not coming from a local branch the minimum spend is ¬£20. To clarify, I didn't spend ¬£20 on the initial order they got wrong and it's not my issue that they send the order from a completely different branch.2. Because they got the order wrong they were willing to make the minimum charge ¬£15 but would not send a driver to me to collect for less than this.3. The lady I spoke to said she was trying to find a solution but could not offer me anything else and wouldn't send a driver for less than ¬£15, let's not forget that they got the order wrong and so now I'm being requested to pay extra for that. I will not order from this restaurant again and would urge others to check their order immediately on receiving it.

Headache, rapid heart rate, sickness in stomach, stinging and itching on skin and feeling pretty bad all round. Spoke with the manager and refused a refund, he was adamant there was no msg in the food. I tried to explain that the food companies are deceptive nowadays and it was definitely in something in their food, even if it wasn't labelled.  Finally he offered to give me a discount next time, which wasn't much use. In the end he agreed to send out an order with no curry sauce or pastes from their bought in bottles and some egg fried rice. Which i think was reasonable.  If there was no msg or similar toxins in this food i would rate the restaurant 4 stars as the staff are respectful and the actual taste of the food is 4 stars or so. Price however is too high to justify. I won't order from here again because i value my health and after this strong msg reaction and the adamant and honest belief from the manager that no msg was in the food, clearly they don't know what is in it, and as they don't make their food from scratch and instead use cheap bought in pastes [coarse language] I won't be wasting my money here again.  Whether it is specifically msg or not, it is something very close to that and very unhealthy.

At 8.15pm I tried calling the Ewell branch, again at 8.30pm, 8.45pm, 9pm and 9.30pm each time an automated voice told me there was no one to answer my call and to leave a message.  There‚Äôs no customer service number or email, so I used the Paya Webchat to find out what was happening.  They couldn‚Äôt assist me as they only deal with the website. They confirmed my order, but couldn‚Äôt give an ETA and basically told me not worry it should arrive soon, but to keep calling the number!At this point I just wanted to cancel, but unable to do that, I contacted my bank for advice, and was told the transaction had already gone through.  The bank gave me a number for what I assumed was customer services, but no it was the Webchat, who repeated what was said earlier.  After waiting 2 hours I was past being hungry,  but I was stuck unable to cancel an order, that I no longer wanted and could very well turn up at midnight.  But that seems acceptable to Paya as long as it‚Äôs delivered job done. At 9:52pm  I got a call from the driver, he couldn‚Äôt find my address, so could I come and collect it from him in the street.  Turns out he had gone to the wrong building, what was more incredulous he had actually parked directly in front of my building!  The food I waited nearly 3 hours and no longer wanted arrived cold, congealed and didn‚Äôt look appetising at all.  It‚Äôs no surprise that after reheating in the microwave it was completely tasteless.   Paya took my money and I didn‚Äôt get what I paid for.

With over 25 years of history, Paya has stood the test of time because of the quality of its food, service and surroundings"".","Really fancied Thai food as it's so fresh tasting and colourful and Paya Friend Barnet came up in the search engine as the only place that delivered to my post code. I ordered chicken satay and crispy crab claws with plum sauce for starters and chicken pad Thai for myself and Chicken Green curry for my sister. When they delivered the driver complained that there was no parking near my home and he had to park a mile away and walk a mile.The food arrived in lovely containers and got chop sticks. The peanut sauce for the satay chicken was warm and of jelly consistency and the crispy crab claws came with a chilli sauce and both tasted awful and bland.At this point I rang the restaurant to say the sauces are wrong and spoke to Mohsen who was in denial that the crispy crab claws come with a plum sauce, after checking he agreed. He informed me that their peanut sauce always came like that. I told him I was left dissatisfied with the starters and wanted a refund on these and that we had not yet tasted the mains. He told me that because I paid by card online that he was unable to refund my card but could offer a credit note. I told him I was not satisfied with the starters and would not be coming buying from food again therefore a credit note was pointless.When I asked for a refund on my card he said if his driver had taken the payment at the door on his credit card machine then a refund could be given but because it was done over the web page this wasn't permitted, however he would speak to his manager. He kept me waiting for a few minutes and came back on the line and told me his manager said no refund only credit. I asked to be put through to the manager and he said I called him and this is what he said.Then he got angry and told me that I hadn't even tried the main and what was I complaining about, I hung up the phone as I felt I was getting angry.My sister and i tried the mains - Chicken Thai green curry that tasted like chicken swimming in dish water and my Chicken Pad Thai that tasted like crushed peanuts smeared over over cooked noodles with overcooked chicken - disgusting.My sister and I gathered all the food and threw it in the bin and called Top Wok to place a chinese meal as Paya and their Thai food definitely did not live up to to our expectations nor look as advertised on their web page.I called the restaurant back and asked to speak to Mohsen, when he came on the line I told him the mains were disgusting too, and that originally I was not asking for a full refund, but now will be writing to his manager demanding a full refund to which he replied that he was surprised as I was the first person to complain about the food. I told him the chef hasn't a clue how to make Thai food.PLEASE NEVER BUY FOOD FROM THIS PLACE."

This charge is meant to cover your Wi-Fi, smart tv and ice machines etc. The smart tv in our room was not working and it took 3 days to get it fixed. There is meant to be ice available on every floor and it is only available on some. The bathroom/toilet is separated from the bedroom only by the shower glass. The reception staff were not very helpful and were quite standoffish. In contrast, the staff in the foyer at the self checkin/out were very helpful. Overall I would stay in the same area and possibly the same hotel but I would be aware of the hotel‚Äôs many deficits."

We asked for the pizza to not be spicy at all as the pizza will be for the child. They brought us a very spicy pizza.2. I brought a cheesecake with apricot (cake bought from Paul) ans I asked them to place the cake in the fridge until we will need it at the end. They didn't put the cake in the fridge, the cheesecake and apricots were nearly melting down.. Because of this, it was very hard to cut the cake in slices.. The taste changed as well, as they kept the cake outside and it was very warm..3. I brought in candels to be used on the top of the cake and I asked them to use all the candles.. They light 4 candles only because they were lazy and didn't care about my request.. I felt weird to see 4 candles on my cake..At the end because I asked about the remaining candles they brought back part of them..4. Bella Cosa added automatically on top of the bill their tips, eveb though the service was horrible.. Bringing our bill up to over GBP 200.5. We ordered 5 glasses of perenoni beer.. 2 of them came with some small solid bits that were quite at the end of the glass.. We asked them what is happening as the other glasses were ok. They said that they don't know.. We asked for the 2 glasses of beer to be replaced with 2 bottles of peroni. One bottle came in very fast and the other bottle didn't arrive at all.. I had to ask 3 times so that they can bring the 2nd beer.. One of my guests remained without drink quite a while.. Because of this incident.. If you see that something is not ok, you should apologise, and replace asap both of the glasses..6. We were not provided kids menu and we had to order big portions for the 2 little kids...7.

1,"Swan, Shakespeare's Globe",['Restaurant'],2.7,2023-06-03,Rod,Truly terrible food,,"I booked this for 12 people back in June and the food was truly terrible.   First we received hardly any of the side dishes that we had ordered. Secondly, most of the main courses were truly terrible from a culinary point of view - the chicken appeared to be some sort of reconstituted mush, rather than proper pieces of chicken and generally our entire party left unsatisfied with the standard of the food.  We did not let it spoil the occasion which was the meeting of two families for the first time ahead of a wedding, but it was a real disappointment to find that a restaurant in such a prestigious location could perform so badly food wise (the service was ok).  We have now had the wedding and I have been meaning to writing this review for some time.   I was also unhappy that booking via the intermediary (I think it was 'Design my Night' that had to be used as you could not book direct), had a checkbox for terms and condition that had to be completed but the page to view them was not available.  Think twice before you book this venue for a special occasion."

The app's user-friendly interface made it easy to set my preferences, including budget, occasion, preferred location.Three hours before my scheduled time, I received a notification that sent a thrill through me.
