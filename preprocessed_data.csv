5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2023-07-11,Landmark Space,Outstanding level of service,"Dinggly’s wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2022-09-22,Tom Maitland,A great service and fantastic product,"Dinggly’s wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2021-09-30,Abdul Wahed Khan,Best Paging System,"Dinggly’s wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

I also showed the waitress the zillionaires member code as it says too (first time I used it) the waitress went off and then came back and said that I could not have the free starter, no explanation I just could not have it, she said do you want to speak to the manager I said yes.The manager comes over I explain I have a code she takes it and I said that the waitress said I cant have it, no explanation, so off she goes and then comes back and says that the code is not able to be used on a Friday and did I still want the starter I said yes and thanks for letting me know that it could not be used, and tells the waitress that I want the order still.The waitress comes over 5 minutes later and asks again do I still want the starter again yes I still want the starter.The starters arrived after 45minutes, now the restaurant was not busy, and once the starter was finished the mains took ages to arrive also.The food is ok and I like the flavours but the portion size has been reduced and I would not normally be hungry still after going out for a meal, and especially after eating fresh pasta which is filling, but on this occasion I was.The manager came over and I asked for the bill she walked off, I thought to go get the bill as she was by what looked like a till, then she disappeared and we could not see her, then we noticed her doing stuff behind the bar I think she was sorting glasses or stocking the fridge.So, we went to the front counter and eventually she came over and I paid, also it turns out that with the use of the zillionaires club I should have been entitled to a free garlic bread, but I have lost out on that now because should have been given to me on my visit.Overall not the best and I will think long and hard before returning, if I ever do.

Search by food type, price, key features or a combination of factors to find the perfect restaurant for your needs requirements and budget.   

Or why not give the gift of a wonderful dining experience with one of our universal restaurant gift vouchers.  Available in monetary values from £20 to £500 and redeemable at all of the restaurants listed on the Gourmet Guide our universal restaurant gift vouchers are the ideal gift for foodies or people who have got everything.","Caution when redeeming!!!!,  my husband was gifted a £50 Gourmet Guide voucher from work during lockdown and as soon as 19th June passed we felt we wanted to use the voucher to give the restaurants the chance to build their trade up again and a the thought of a little bit of fine dining was the lovely too. We chose the Red Lion in Cricklade. The communication from GG was excellent. They confirmed the booking and told us we weren’t to worry about taking the voucher as it wasn’t necessary, the pub was expecting us. I then got another email wishing us a lovely evening on the Friday prior to the booking.  On arrival to the venue we were a little dubious as always when using a voucher, but true to the confirmation received from GG, the booking had been received and our table was waiting for us. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed the experience very much. I even texted my daughter To say we had found a lovely place and that they should try it. The embarrassment started when the bill came and the price was for the full amount £83. I told her that we had booked through GG and that we had redeemed a £50 voucher when making the reservation through GG.  She then said she would check with her boss, then came back to the table and asked for the voucher or some kind of proof. GG said I would not need the voucher!!! So embarrassing! She then went off with the voucher. 5 minutes later the Maitre came over to say that they didn’t accept vouchers and that we were fortunate as the voucher was valid until the end of the year so we could use it somewhere else! Mortified by now, we refused and showed him the 2 emails from GG. He then shot off and we saw him speaking on the phone. Perhaps to his superior. He then came over and started to backtrack and apologise because his superior hadn’t told him or any of the staff about GG. He then asked if we had enjoyed our meal and proceeded to charge us £33. The whole final experience spoiled the night. We felt stupid and cheap, we decided last minute not to leave the £10 tip which we thought the staff deserved for the simple reason that we were embarrassed. Lack of communication from management to staff ruined our lovely evening. So our advice to voucher redeemers is be cautious. We later wondered if we should have mentioned it on arrival but GG said there was no need to even show the voucher, that the venue would be aware. If we had mentioned it, we would have probably not been shown to our table as the Maitre had no idea whatsoever. Unbelievable!  Finally, these vouchers are issued to people with good intention but sometimes they are a pain in the butt. Great meal but awfully embarrassing.",caution redeem husband gift gourmet guid voucher work lockdown soon june pass felt want use voucher give restaur chanc build trade thought littl bit fine dine love chose red lion cricklad commun go excel confirm book told us worri take voucher necessari pub expect us got anoth email wish us love even friday prior book arriv venu littl dubiou alway use voucher true confirm receiv go book receiv tabl wait us meal excel enjoy experi much even test daughter say found love place tri embarrass start bill came price full amount told book go redeem voucher make reserv go said would check boss came back tabl ask voucher kind proof go said would obviat voucher embarrass went voucher minut later maitr came say accept voucher fortun voucher valid end year could use somewher els mortifi refus show email go shot saw speak phone perhap superior came start backtrack apologis superior told staff go ask enjoy meal proceed charg us whole final experi spoil night felt stupid cheap decid last minut leav tip thought staff deserv simpl reason embarrass lack commun manag staff ruin love even advic voucher redeem cautiou later wonder mention arriv go said need even show voucher venu would awar mention would probabl differ shown tabl maitr idea whatsoev unbeliev final voucher issu peopl good intent sometim pain butt great meal aw embarrass

The food was decent and the service was pleasant. My problem is the unethical manner of payment. There was a QR code on the table which said you can scan it to pay.

That aside, the service was positive so I was happy to pay the SC. I went to pay my part of the bill (£14.50) plus SC which came to £16.32. However this is when it got dodgy.

I can imagine alot of customers get caught out by this because you may think that the SC has not been added and go ahead and pay the extra money. What is the justification for this? What is the justification for requiring the customer to actively unselect a button when they are already paying the 12.5% SC? At the very least you must not have the £2 pre selected option. The customer needs to actively consent and understand what they are paying for, which means giving them the choice to add additional service charge if they feel it is warranted. By pre selecting an option, you are taking away the choice which is unfair and unethical. It is prejudicial to the customer and financially benefits the company.

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Restaurant: Manchester Trafford CentreDate and time of visiting: 23/3 18:00-19:42No. of pax: 3 We settled the £32.20 bill by 2 gift cards worth £35 (£20 and £15 respectively), it was supposed to have an amount of £2.8 balance left in the gift card - which is just a primary level subtraction.After having settled the bill we asked to have our print-at-home gift cards back but were repeatedly told by the waiter ""No balance left and it's in the bin"". Manager came through and the discussion lasted for a while but we found there wasn't any way to reach the point of understanding - unfortunately even more confusing.We were full of doubts: 1. Waiter kept saying there wasn't any balance left in the gift card          - Did it mean there was £0 balance left in the gift cards? But the bill was just £32.202. Manager telling us they can't give back the balance           - Was she presuming we requesting a new issue of gift card with an updated balance? Of course we not, we do know any gift card balance will be updated automatically and it is unnecessary to issue a new one after each time of consumption3. They insisted not to give back the printout gift cards to us because ""those were in the bin""           - Although the balance can be checked online without having a physical gift card in hand, we don't think it's appropriate to throw away a cash equivalent gift card with unspent value which can be used by anyone          - We can't understand the insistency of refusing to return something belongs to us, even though something might be considered as wasteWe gave up to discuss any more and just asked to get back the threw-away gift cards as well as the receipt of the meal.Later the night, we checked the balance of the gift cards online and found the total value of £35 in the gift cards was used up (That's why the gift cards became waste of the bin) and found the difference of £2.8 was counted as tips which was listed in the bill.It's meaningless to discuss if their service worth this £2.8 tips, it is completely an unauthorised transaction - no one has ever made us aware of this transaction even though there had been a prolonged conversation about the bill and the gift cards.Please Zizzi can you give a response to these?1. Is this a tradition of your restaurant to use up customer's gift card value and count the balance as tips without customers' consent? (Fortunately we haven't bought a £100 worth gift card)2. Is this also a tradition of your restaurant to throw away customers' gift card and refuse to return upon customers' request?

Nisbets first email to me dated 2 March 2023 enclosed quote for “Gas coin operated dryer” (Item 1&1a), with delivery mid-May. We accepted the quote on 6 March 2023 (2) and paid Nisbets £2076 on 9 May 2023.(we tried to pay by credit card on 3 May but Nisbets refused as the card was in my name & not in the name of the Company). On 12 June Nisbets emailed (3) that Coin machine was extra £276, (even though Coin Machine was included in their Quote) this was paid to Nisbets by credit card the same day. On 29 June 2023 a new invoice was received from Nisbets and we replied FAO. Nisbets Sales Director (4).Nisbets replied 30 June 2023 (4a). On 11 July 2023 a letter was sent recorded delivery to the CEO of Nisbets signed by the two Directors (5). The Dryer alone was delivered on 13 July 2023, but without the coin boxes!  On 4 August 2023 a second letter was sent recorded delivery to the CEO of Nisbets together with the reply received from the Head of Customer Operations dated 13 July 2023 (6). Nisbets in the person of their Legal Counsel wrote a reply to the letter dated 4 August 2023 (7), to which no acknowledgement nor reply has been made. The Coin machine package was delivered on 25 August 2023, with parts only. No circuit drawing and no installation instructions enclosed!2.	We are a Private Sheltered Housing retirement complex consisting of 65 separate properties, approximately two thirds are 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, Lounge, Kitchen, dormer bungalows, and one third are maisonettes. Every ground floor property has a patio on which a Conservatory may be built. Every property looks onto a large grass area. There is ample parking space and a Community Room & Launderette consisting of a washing machine and commercial dryer. NO outside laundry drying allowed. 3.	We asked for £5000 compensation is for the inconvenience caused by the unreasonable delay. For the Residents to dry their laundry means taking a taxi to and from the towns Launderette. They are aged between 70 and 100. Nisbets refused & stated that they would use Legal Counsel against us!!4.	I believe any Company has a duty & responsibility to a purchaser from the time of        acceptance until of delivery to the purchaser, certainly within the British Isles, and cannot opt out any legal wording produced by themselves. I believe Nisbets have unfair contract terms that are contrary to Consumer Rights Act 2022 regarding Delivery of goods that “must deliver your goods to you within 30 days of when you place your order” It took Nisbets 128 days for the Dryer & 172 days for the Coin boxes.

1,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-08-16,David Haddad,My recent experience with Nando's…,,"My recent experience with Nando's online order left me feeling extremely disappointed and dissatisfied. Not only did they make a mistake with my order by providing regular chips instead of the large ones I had requested, but their customer service response was far from satisfactory. Despite acknowledging their error, Nando's refused to replace the chips or offer a refund for the portion of difference. This negative encounter has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I feel compelled to share my experience in this review.I decided to order from Nando's through their online platform for convenience. The process itself was relatively straightforward, allowing me to select the items I desired and customise my order according to my preferences. However, it is worth noting that the accuracy of the final order is crucial in ensuring customer satisfaction.Upon arriving at the restaurant to pick up my order, I was disheartened to discover that Nando's had made a mistake. Instead of receiving the large chips I had paid for, I was given regular-sized chips. This discrepancy was immediately noticeable and disappointing, as it meant I did not receive what I had paid for.Naturally, I contacted Nando's customer service to address the issue and seek a resolution. While they apologized for the inconvenience caused, their response fell short of what one would expect from a reputable establishment. Despite admitting their mistake, they were unwilling to replace the chips or provide a refund for the difference in price between regular and large chips.The lack of accountability displayed by Nando's in this situation is truly disheartening.

No explanation, or email to confirm.

With Nisbets next day delivery promise and a huge product range, spanning over 20,000 lines from Chef Clothing, Knives and Utensils through to Cooking Machines and Refrigeration. It is no wonder they are number 1 and used by hundreds of thousands of customers worldwide.","The worst customer service - no response and if I do get a response, it's unhelpful and slow.Firstly, I spoke to Holly about collecting the fridge on 5th October. She arranged collection for the 6th October. Ref 1142191. Nobody arrived. (She also didn't mention the £80 fee that would be deducted). I also told her that I need the driver to bring a delivery box as the original delivery men took the box and pallet when they took the fridge out the box. (Holly said she would arrange this). Anyway, I then called again and spoke to Georgia the day after or couple days later to return another order. Ref: RMA2394378. Nobody collected the following day.I then called again and spoke to Ben on Monday 9th Oct to ask why this hasn't been collected. He said he doesn't know why. He then told me ref RMA2394378 will be collected on the 10th (and it was - thank goodness). However he told me he would get someone to call me to confirm the ref: 1142191 collection day. I received a phone call on 10th October from a man named Nad which did not explain things clearly. He then informed me of the £80 deduction cost (which was not mentioned to me by any other staff members in the beginning over the phone). I told him that the fridge originally arrived and the delivery men took the box and pallet which was strange. The fridge was too big for our place, and was put into our back storage room with no use. I emailed on the same day of the delivery, and asked if this fridge could be collected. (No email response, so that's when I called Holly on the 6th Oct as mentioned above). You can see it is not easy for me to always make time to call, and to chase up when deliveries are not made properly, or when they are not collected. You are not the only company that I order from for my businesses. Moving forward on Wednesday 11th October, a man called and spoke to my colleague at 8.15am. He was unable to find the place and said he will cancel the collection if he can't find us (we are so easy to find, and when deliveries are made, they seem to find us completely fine! What a coincidence that for a collection, they seem to be struggling). So I attempted to call him back and no answer to my call or messages. The fridge is still sitting here for a long time and it seems that nobody cares or wants to collect this fridge. Can somebody please arrange collection for this item. I am quite concerned as to why this isn't being collected especially as I have notified you right from the beginning as soon as the fridge arrived.I emailed on the 11th Oct to see what happened and WHY the fridge was not collected. Nazmus responded and said he would check and get back to me. It is now Friday 13th and no response as of yet.Avoid ordering items from this company as they do not deal with any issues that occur later on, or if you simply want to return something.UPDATE: They just emailed me after receiving this review, no apology, no acknowledgment at the fact that they took so long, messed around with me for collection. Apparently they will collect today at 12pm. Let's see. I will come back for an update on here. It is so disappointing that I have to leave a trustpilot review in order for somebody to respond. Disgusting.Update on your response: firstly, the item was very ugly looking and bulky hence the return (not that it was too big for the premises). Also, you collected this but with no box! The driver just took it away on a palette. Secondly, I don’t sit behind a screen all day , I email, and simply expect a response. If I don’t get a response, I will chase that company either 2 or 3 weeks after (this doesn’t usually happen with other companies, but with Nisbet it’s hard to get a response back) other bigger companies simply ‘locate’ my email and respond back - something your customer service are unable to do. I can see my email was sent, and the automated response sent, however nobody actually responded on your behalf. Rather than criticise me for taking a ‘few weeks’ to chase after my email (when I finally have time to CHASE you because you were too disorganised to locate the email) you should just take account for your mistakes. I recommend you to apologise to customers instead and take into consideration the wrong actions/ slow replies on your part rather than just try to wriggle your way out.",worst custom servic respons get respons help spoke holli collect fridg th octob arrang collect th octob red nobodi arriv also mention fee would deduc also told need driver bring deliveri box origin deliveri men took box pallet took fridg box holli said would arrang anyway call spoke georgia day coupl day later return anoth order red rma2394378 nobodi collect follow call spoke ben monday th oct ask collect said know told red rma2394378 collect thank good howev told would get someon call confirm red collect day receiv phone call octob man name explain thing clearli inform deduct cost mention staff member begin phone told fridg origin arriv deliveri men took box pallet strang fridg big place put back storag room use remain day deliveri ask fridg could collect email respons call holli th oct mention see difficult alway make time call chase deliv unmad properli spread compani order busi move forward wednesday octob man call spoke colleagu unabl find place said cancel collect ca find us easi find deliv made seem find us complet fine coincid collect seem struggl attempt call back answer call messag fridg still sit long time seem nobodi care want collect fridg somebodi pleas arrang collect item quit concern collect especi notifi right begin soon fridg remain oct see happen fridg spread name respond said would check get back friday respons order item compani deal issu occur later simpli want return remain receiv review apolog acknowledg fact took long miss around collect appar collect today pm let see come back updat disappoint leav trustpilot review order somebodi respond respons firstli item ugli look bulki henc return big premis also collect box driver took away palat secondli sit behind screen day email simpli expect respons get respons chase compani either week usual happen compani nisbet hard get respons back bigger compani simpli locat email respond back someth custom servic unabl see email sent automat respons sent howev nobodi actual respond behalf rather criticis take week chase email final time chase disorganis locat email take account mistak recommend apologis custom instead take consider wrong slow repli part rather tri wriggl way

Manager came through and the discussion lasted for a while but we found there wasn't any way to reach the point of understanding - unfortunately even more confusing.We were full of doubts: 1. Waiter kept saying there wasn't any balance left in the gift card          - Did it mean there was £0 balance left in the gift cards? But the bill was just £32.202. Manager telling us they can't give back the balance           - Was she presuming we requesting a new issue of gift card with an updated balance? Of course we not, we do know any gift card balance will be updated automatically and it is unnecessary to issue a new one after each time of consumption3. They insisted not to give back the printout gift cards to us because ""those were in the bin""           - Although the balance can be checked online without having a physical gift card in hand, we don't think it's appropriate to throw away a cash equivalent gift card with unspent value which can be used by anyone          - We can't understand the insistency of refusing to return something belongs to us, even though something might be considered as wasteWe gave up to discuss any more and just asked to get back the threw-away gift cards as well as the receipt of the meal.Later the night, we checked the balance of the gift cards online and found the total value of £35 in the gift cards was used up (That's why the gift cards became waste of the bin) and found the difference of £2.8 was counted as tips which was listed in the bill.It's meaningless to discuss if their service worth this £2.8 tips, it is completely an unauthorised transaction - no one has ever made us aware of this transaction even though there had been a prolonged conversation about the bill and the gift cards.Please Zizzi can you give a response to these?1. Is this a tradition of your restaurant to use up customer's gift card value and count the balance as tips without customers' consent? (Fortunately we haven't bought a £100 worth gift card)2.

In discussion with the Manager, he said ""So why are you coming for Afternoon Tea when you can't have butter!""  This made us feel very uncomfortable.

What's more, we offer a great customer services department and a 3 year warranty as standard to non-corporate accounts - we stand behind our products, after all, we invented the coaster or customer pager back in 1993. Our updated CS series of CS6, CS7 and the new CS8 leads the world in pager technology.

But LRS UK is about much more than coaster pagers, we offer emergency paging systems for on-site messaging, custom call buttons, the Table Tracker that identifies the exact location of seated customers and much more. 

We are also a key supplier in the United Kingdom of Two-way Radios from Motorola, ICOM, Kenwood, Entel and others. We manufacture our own earpieces and microphones that we guarantee are the best you can buy - ask for a free sample.

If you want quality paging and communications equipment that is designed to last with excellent customer support LRS UK will take care of you - that's why we have customers on our books going right the way back to 2001, and even further for non-paging equipment.

","Poor pager systems. Seem to stop working after six months. You have to unclip them from the holders to charge. So the holders end up breaking too. The buzzer system hasn’t got a page all setting which would be ideal at times.In summary, there are a lot better pager systems out there at will last a lot longer and will withstand constant use.",poor paper system seem stop work six month uncl holder charg holder end break buzz system got page set would ideal summari lot better paper system last lot longer withstand constant use

Seated by the till at a low brown coffee formica table I was shocked to learn that this was indeed our table - not set ready waiting for our arrival and not the window seat as discussed during a courtesycall from the restaurant the day before. I paid £200 for 5 afternoon teas, with a drink each and 10% service charge - booked weeks in advance.I'd seen the online menu so with these prices I expected the service and the ambiance.After the staff handed over their shift to one another, the joys of being in the area of the till and as the pop music blared out the speakers, so the long awaited drinks at £10 each came out - and at the same time as the food. We had no opportunity to toast our celebration and enjoy the drinks.Instead we had to juggle them whilst a continual barrage of crockery came our way onto a table not fit for purpose - 5 side plates, a cake stand, a plate of scones, 5 dessert pots, 5 tea pots and 5 cups and saucers... I think that was everything...oh 2 pots of jam and 2 pots of cream - and the cutlery, wrapped in a paper serviette, it doesn't come with a much cheaper feel than that. To top the disappointment I'd given  the staff some extra little cake decorations to personalise the afternoon tea with as it was a special surprise for one of our party - they didn't materialise.On the plus side our Tea - as it stewed while we had our drink - was free to refill and the food was good,",exquisit experi restaur realiti like expens cafe floor seat till low brown coffe form tabl shock learn inde tabl rise readi wait arriv window seat discuss courtesycal restaur day paid afternoon tear drink servic charg book week seen onlin menu price expect servic staff hand shift one anoth joy area till pop music blame speaker long await drink came time food opportun toast celebr enjoy jungl whilst continu carriag crockeri came way onto tabl disagre purpos side plate cake stand plate stone dessert pot tea pot cup saucer think everyth oh pot jam pot cream cutleri wrap paper serviett come much cheaper feel top disappoint given staff extra littl cake decor person afternoon tea special surpris one parti plu side tea strew drink free refil food good

I further sent an email to the Bournemouth branch to make sure our requirements could be met before arrival (a copy of which I still have).  When we were seated, the waiter brought along the menu.  I mentioned that I had sent in our special requests by email.  He seemed perplexed so the Manager was called over as the waiter could not understand our request for no butter on the bread, no mayo or cream for one and one person is vegetarian.  In discussion with the Manager, he said ""So why are you coming for Afternoon Tea when you can't have butter!""  This made us feel very uncomfortable.  My mother is 91 and cannot tolerate unprocessed butter, fats or cheese of any kind (her mother was the same) but is fine with butter when cooked in cakes, etc.  I said I had sent the branch an email to make sure our food intolerances could be catered for.  He said, ""I don't have time to read emails!"".  In this day and age of so many food allergies and intolerances, isn't it extremely important not to overlook customers' requests?!  The Manager implied that our food allergies and intolerances could be sorted on arrival but, in my experience, every venue we have been to before for Afternoon Tea has requested knowledge of this beforehand.  Despite this, the tea was very nice apart from the hard scone which must have been warmed up in the microwave.  For myself, vegetarian meant brie, brie or brie mini rolls.

Well over 45 mins later the food had not  arrived but I guess with only two chefs & a restaurant half full along with outside orders we kind of set the expectation. Lots of serving staff looking like they had no idea what they were doing. More disappointed that we weren’t at least spoken to or acknowledged and that for me is a big fail in customer service .We ended up leaving but not before paying for the two drinks we had and no apology.  We’ve been to the one in Oxford and that was awesome but I won’t be returning I’m afraid.,decid go winston franco mania fair book restaur busi overlay sat tabl presum manag whisper hear say came serv us caught attent well mind later food leav guess two chess restaur half full along outsid order kind set expect lot serv staff look like idea disappoint least spoken acknowledg big fail custom servic end leav pay two drink apolog one oxford awesom return afraid
