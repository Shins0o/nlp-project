All but professionally. Before doing business with them, I wish I had read some online reviews. There must be a ton of trustworthy businesses offering comparable catering services!In conclusion: For my daughter´s 30th birthday in France, I reserved a dinner on their website (EUR 100,00/person without bread and drinks), but ended up making spaghetti for my guests two hours later - imagine the enormity of the dishes ;-). Additionally, the chef apologizes and explains that the budget he had was about EUR 12,50 per person. The talks I had with Dineindulge's service desk were extremely rude to me and much below the standard you would expect from a business that makes the claim to be highly professional and customer-focused.

I don’t know the area, I have no contacts, what am I supposed to do? Are they seriously telling me that a huge company like that can’t find 1 single other chef. In my opinion, this is their mess-up therefore they should be working around the clock, paying chefs a premium if needs be to get someone to cook for us like promised. It put the BIGGEST dampener on my wedding day which I’ll never forgive them for. You only get married once, and they ruined it for me. Please whatever you do, do not book this company!"

Avoid at all costs if you want certainty that a chef will show up.I booked a chef through this company for a hen do in April months in advance. 7 days before my event I received an email saying that the chef assigned to my event was no longer available and was told that there were no other chefs available that evening. This was incredibly frustrating and stressful so close to the time, and with it being the key part of an event (as most of their bookings are) I had no flexibility. Finding another company in such short notice for a Saturday evening booking was not an option. I asked about other options and was told that they could keep looking for chefs, but couldn’t say the likelihood of being able to find one - not helpful when planning an event. Eventually I cancelled some other activities and reorganised the entire weekend to get a booking on the Friday night, and was given a 10% discount - not good enough in my opinion.At the time I thought this was a one off so didn’t write a review. However, my boyfriend (who is currently planning an event) has just had exactly the same thing happen to him, and was sent an email with exactly the same vaguely worded email which does not seem to be a coincidence! He is now left 9 days before an event (again a Saturday evening) which he cannot rearrange, and has been told that they will keep looking for a chef and that there is a “50/50 chance of finding one”.Looking at other reviews this seems to be a recurring problem with others having the same issue. It’s simply not good enough and for a company that specialises in providing an indulgent experience for special events, cancelling a booking with such short notice should never be considered acceptable.I appreciate that some last minute situations can’t be helped, but the company clearly has no feasible back up solution in place. To happen once could be excused but to happen twice (2 out of 2 bookings) is outrageous.This is no reflection on the chefs - who have been great, but the company has shocking management, they’re clearly overbooking events and should have enough back up chefs to ensure that this situation never happens. They can only help you if you rearrange your entire weekend or event to work around their schedule."

We arranged a dinner for 11 people at at air bnb for a hen party. We were all so excited and the food in the pictures looked amazing. We contacted them on the day of, asking if we could change one of meals from fish to streak (knowing it was short notice) and they said yes! It was all looking so positive.They arrived late (it happens so this wasn’t a huge frustration) with their Waitrose bags - they had literally been to the supermarket before coming to us..we know this because the chef told us. We were expecting better quality food then supermarket bought!The starters came out, one was nice and the other, the chicken one was cold! Like actually cold. But we thought, it’s okay let’s see what mains are like. The mains came out…they forgot the get the extra steak so…even though they confirmed we could change a fish to a steak, they didn’t do it. The mains were barely edible. The steak was already pre sliced…who slices up a sirloin steak to serve?! And the fish (although they tell us it was lemon sole but won’t show us proof by receipt) was horrific. It looked boiled! It also was not what we ordered. We had ordered a lovely tempura fish and we got a cold what looked like boiled fish. The potatoes weren’t what we ordered either. And finally the desserts…all cold and nothing like the pictures on the menu. They were horrid. As they we’re clearing up one of the guests said to the chef, don’t take mine it’s Cold so I’ll microwave it and be just laughed and said fair enough. The custard was package bought and NOT EVEN HEATED UP!We didn’t complain on the night because we didn’t want to ruin the vibe but also…it’s not like they had spare ingredients and could re cook it it. So we left it and emailed the company after the hen do. They have offered us a £60 credit and that’s it. They basically said that because we didn’t complain to the chefs (I mean seriously, how awkward would that have been) on the night it falls out of their t&c’s. We explained that £60 doesn’t even cover 2 meals so what they are saying is…here is a £60 so you can go ahead and spend more money with us! They’re asking us to spend more money and trust them…absolutely not.We have gone back and forth and can confirm we are definitely not happy with the outcome. Never ever use this company. Horrific service and the chefs looked like this was their first gig out of culinary school. Had we have known we would have gone to the supermarket and cooked ourselves. I wish I could add photos to this review because…you’d see how 🤢 it was.Update: one of the guests tipped and they have offered us our tip and one main meal as a refund and £100 credit. Still absolutely rubbish considering we spent over £550 on the meal."

We were all excited about coming together and enjoy what looked to be a delicious menu.  Unfortunately Dineindulge could not deliver as they cancelled my booking 3 days before the special event, leaving me without any alternative option to celebrate this special event.  They said they had reached out to other chefs but I don't believe that they did as the location was in close proximity to London and other popular SE locations.  I felt completely let down for my Dad's 70th birthday celebration.  Furthermore, when they tried to change my booking they offered a lunchtime event, which would have not worked as many of us had pre-booked babysitters to be able to enjoy a child-free evening to celebrate my Dad's special birthday.  I explained this and the representative was rude and off-hand that I wasn't just accepting their alternative offer despite me booking this several weeks ahead of the event.  They also said they would call back whilst they were looking into other options for me but I had to chase multiple times as they weren't calling back or keeping me in the loop.  I think they just took the booking and no intention of fulfilling it due to the short notice of the cancellation.  I called alternative companies to try and rectify the ruined event but unfortunately there was no alternative.  I would avoid this company if you are booking for an important occasion as it led to many disappointed people and wasted journeys from different corners of the UK."

We received notification that there was an issue with providing a chef 11days before the event and so we said we were prepared to change the date. On the day before it was due to take place we were informed that a chef had not been found so it was cancelled. All monies were immediately returned but this did not compensate for our daughter's disappointment. We were told that we would have a reduction if we booked again.As I have already given specific booking details and stated quite clearly and succinctly what transpired. Perhaps I should have added that Dineindulge complicated matters by phoning on a private number which I was hesitant to answer after receiving a number of scam calls recently. I compromised by changing the date and was prepared to meet them halfway expecting that they would prioritise my booking as it had been placed in such good time, however that proved not to be the case.

(If you do reply to this, please find another one)All sorts of guff about why they cancelled, which might or might not be true. The bottom line is they are a big company that doesn't have a back up system fit for purpose. If they did have, we would have had a chef.As compensation they have offered to give a free dinner up to the cost of the meal (£600) You might think that generous but, the moment has gone and, having let you down once , you might well not be that keen to let them into your house in the future.

All the food was cooked off-site, with many dishes also fully pre-prepared. Consequently some lacked freshness, particularly the mackerel which had dried out.  The balance between the bites was also a little odd - some had more than 2 per person, others just one.  Of the mains, the Thai chicken was very bland with only the vaguest hint of any spices ( I understand that this is a personal taste thing). The lamb was nice, as was the salmon, although for small bite size pieces it would have been nicer skinned. Overall the quality was ok, but nothing better than you could get by ordering take-away from Wagamama for instance. The meal had that takeaway feel anyway, with the food in the middle of the table, served in tin trays the were so flimsy it was difficult to pass the around without them crumpling and spilling the food. The good bits wee the chef was polite, courteous and helpful. He cooked self-supplied nibbles for my younger kids (the only cooking he did) and left the place spotless. Overall this is a great idea and the benefits of not having to prepare in your own home for a celebration are obvious; however, on this experience I would warn against selecting any of the relax meals, as the presentation and overall feel and quality of the food do not strike me as value for money. For near £60/head (with suggested gratuity) you can eat better whilst still not cooking yourself.  This may be a different experience with the higher value menus, where the chef actually cooks and there is a plated service, but I am not sure I will invest the money to find out."

The party was scheduled to start at 3:00 pm and the chef arrived only at 3:10 pm of raw food and started cooking over 2 hours late. I never felt so humiliated in front of the guests I invited, and some of them were from a different country. The kids were hungry, crying and we needed to order pizza. Also, we have not received the starters that were paid for 5 days before the event and we have not received a refund yet either. As a result, the food was served around 16.30, the steaks were cold and the party was ruined for me. When I tried to call them and get some explanation about what was happening, they said that they did not understand what had happened and that the manager would contact me on Monday (in 2 days), which also did not happen, no one called, apologized and did not offer any compensation for the spoiled events.  I still can't get away from what happened, nobody's ever humiliated me like this for my own money."

He turned up before the meal to prepare and was friendly and chatty whilst working. The quality of the meal was superb and very timely. I would happily use the service again and certainly would ask for Ryan to cook again.

The food was absolutely phenomenal, he explained everything we were having, all allergies were catered for (we were amazed at the dairy free roast potato and feta salad- it was amazing), and he was brilliant with our children too. He cleaned up after himself which meant the evening was so hassle free. It was a wonderful experience and we have felt looked after all the way through, from booking, organising the menu, right up until our chef left us finishing our desserts."

We were a little disappointed therefore when the chef who arrived turned out to have been bitten by a dog a few weeks ago and was terrified of them...Dineindulge did send an email asking us to 'secure any dogs away from the dining area' just 2 days before our event - a bit difficult when we were already in the holiday home which was open plan. Dogs aren't mentioned in any of their ts and C's before this point. To be fair, the chef was as professional as he could have been, the food was amazing and we couldn't fault how clean the kitchen was afterwards. But the service left a lot to be desired - the chef was clearly very nervous, even though the dogs were in another room, he didn't really engage with the group at all, and in total was only with us for about an hour and 10 minutes. Not quite what we expected for the amount we paid!When we fed back to Dineindulge they blamed the chef, and relied on their one email about dogs - not taking on board that it was their process that let us down or that there were other elements of our evening that weren't great. Whilst admitting the service we received wasn't what they'd expect, they would only offer a discount off a future booking, rather than the partial refund we'd asked for. Would recommend for the quality of food and cooking - not so much for service overall."

After a seamless booking process, our event was cancelled at short notice. Whilst I understand that ‘things happen’, their communication when the issue was brought to their attention was poor. We were not notified of the problem immediately which gave us less time to make alternative arrangements. I only spoken to someone in person 72 hours before the event. The representative explained that emails had been sent 48 hours previously but these were not received. Even had they been, an email is not a suitable way to cancel a booking. They were also less than transparent when discussing compensation. It was implied we would receive financial compensation but in fact this was in the form of vouchers to put towards the cost of a future booking (which we will not be making). Such a shame"

It wasn’t clear in any conversation prior to booking that there were limitations on how many swaps of the menu you could have, andB. It isn’t at all clear that for the 2 Course menu, all of the party has to choose “either” starter and main (or) main and desert - ie you couldn’t have some having starter and main and some have main and desert.This needs to be much clearer, having said that it was a great evening and the food was delicious."

There was great communication throughout.Dan, our chef for the evening, was amazing. He adapted well to working in our rented property. He was very engaging and knowledgeable about the dishes he was serving and also the local Devon produce.We were impressed with the dishes, from the amuse bouche to the cheeseboard and the menu satisfied both the meat eaters and the vegetarian. I can highly recommend Dineindulge and will certainly be using its services in the future. I only wish that I had found this organisation sooner.Thank you for a lovely evening."

The chefs were perfect, my managers and colleagues impressed. Food was beautiful and tasty.The other 3 were friends gatherings, quite intimate, and the chefs always delivered a great service, introducing the dishes, describe them and leaving the kitchen spotless. The booking procedure is simple and the staff in the office is great, as we had some dietary requirements for some of our guests, they were clear, understanding and very helpful.I recommend this company and surely I will keep booking with them."

Covid has unfortunately been with us for 2 years now. Like most people in business I have made contingency plans especially where I had a potential single point of failure. However, despite having 2 years in which to do so, this company has no contingency plan in the event one of its chefs tests positive. Instead, they simply cancel and let you down at the last moment. We had booked 3 nights in one of Kate & Tom's beautiful houses for my parents' Diamond Wedding Anniversary. They recommended DineIndulge (perhaps they should rethink). We booked DineIndulge for the night of the Anniversary so that we could all sit and relax with our parents who, verging on 90, are uncomfortable dining out. DineIndulge cancelled the afternoon before, no contingency plan in place, and too late for us to book an alternative in-house chef. Added to which they still sent automated emails about our forthcoming event! Shockingly unprofessional, utterly unacceptable service and a total lack of basic business acumen."

The booking process was very easy and I was pleasantly surprised by the extent of what was offered. Initially, this was a surprise birthday dinner for my wife comprising of 4 people 2 of whom were vegetarian. DineIndulge suggested that I could add 2 more people for almost no extra cost. This opened the floodgates since the dinner numbers quickly went to 6 and finally ended up as 8 with 3 of those taking vegan options. It made most sense to have the platter menu so I chose the Relax one which would give everyone a nice experience of more than one dish. Before the event, the DineIndulge team offered plenty of good advice in choosing which dishes to have to cater for my party. All through the process there were many changes that the team seamlessly affected for me and nothing was too much trouble. On the day, the chef (Frederic) arrived armed with a huge array of cold boxes and ""chefs stuff"" and just got on with the cooking. The dishes he brought to the table were marvellous. He managed taking plates away, washing them up to be used again and gave us perfect intervals between courses including bringing out a birthday cake with lit candles that I had brought for the occasion. He cleaned everything away and even offered to clean the kitchen floor but we thought he had done quite enough and let him go to his home. I had heard about having chefs at home and to find DineIndulge operating out of the UK but with chefs in France was a real bonus. I would definitely use them again and I believe the service to be great value for money since we had leftovers that lasted another day and a half. I highly recommend DineIndulge..."

My group of six had a 7 course tasting menu.  The company were brilliant at handling dietary requirements (we had a nut allergy and 3 vegetarians). The booking process was excellent, staff were available to speak or called straight back, instructions were clear and our chef was brilliant, very personable, arrived exactly when he said he would and cooked a very delicious meal. In terms of how to rate the experience - overall I was very highly satisfied and as this was a birthday party all guests had a wonderful night and it felt very special. What I would say is that, as someone who eats out a fair bit - the price of the experience is considerably going on the fact you have a chef at your own house. We paid approximately £70 per person and if I was eating out I would have expected the sort of food served to be priced more reasonably at around £45-55 per person. That the food didn't exactly match the equivalent of similarly priced dishes at a restaurant should hardly be surprising given the chefs have to use your own kitchen and do a lot of the preparation in advance - and as I say above the food was still delicious, it just didn't have the exact finishing touches or sophistication of flavour you'd get at a top end restaurant. This I would put more down to the menu planning process which I believe is done centrally rather than the quality of the chef. Therefore, I would highly recommend the Dineindulge experience if you are looking for a very memorable and wonderful evening - just bear in mind you are paying a little more than you would usually to get this experience."

It made the experience that bit more special.We would definitely recommend this chef and DineInDulge to anyone else. We certainly will use them again at some point.Well done and thank you."

And our favourite restaurant had stopped doing Sundays. When I sought ideas from her I was told that if it was mentioned again, by anyone, she'd walk out! So I'd given up... But our children told me I couldn't, so I thought about bringing the best restaurant home to us. I chose DineIndulge because you choose a menu... Much easier than choosing a name that you've never heard of. The Web site was simple to understand and dietary issues are catered for. This was very important as we have 2 gluten intolerant and one dairy intolerant. I spoke to DineIndulge and they took all these potential problems away. The chef called me the day before, as advised, and told me what he needed, and the next day everything went perfectly, right down to the chef announcing and describing each course in his wonderful French accent. We really did bring the Restaurant to our home and our family, all 3 generations, had the best time. Our daughter was really impressed: ""How did you find them?!"". I told the truth, I trusted DineIndulge, and they delivered :-)"

It’s something I’ve always wanted to experience but felt I could neither justify the expense or cope with having someone else in charge of my kitchen!  Due to the initial lockdown I had to defer dates a couple of times - Dineindulge were great, nothing was ever a problem for them, moving of dates etc and they kept in touch.  I wanted to increase my party size, that wasn’t a problem and then I had to reduce it again due to guests having to isolate- again, no issue.  Staff at the end of the phone/email are very polite friendly and knowledgeable.  We finally had our experience this Saturday and wow, what a lovely night we had!  Our chef was relatively local, he was very friendly and yet professional, especially when he chucked me out of my own kitchen to go and enjoy time with my guests 🤣 our food was absolutely delicious, there was more than enough for everyone.  The one and only tiny tiny criticism would be that that I would have liked more time between courses but when I do this again(which I definitely will, as will my guests) I would ask for a bit of a time lapse between courses.  Dineindulge did say that my chef would work to my time but being a first experience I didn’t know what to expect, so we went with the flow, and it was fine. Thank you Dineindulge for a fabulous night and we will be back for more!!"

However the  Dineindulge administration and booking process was farcical. A week after making the booking, confirming date and menus and following full payment Dineindulge confirm they were unable to meet the previously confirmed dining date. When we contacted the Head of Events at Dineindulge there was no acknowledgment that we had finalised arrangements based on the previous received confirmation. Totally unsatisfactory as the event was scheduled for my daughters 30th Birthday.RESPONSE TO REPLYYou never once mentioned a waiting list for the 14th July, what you said was if we can’t get a chef for the 14th is there any other day, I did tell you the 13th would be ok but would rather have the 14th as this was my daughters 30th birthday. You told me that I had to pay the deposit which I did and you would confirm in a few days, you confirmed on Monday 28th by email which stated the 14th. I then went on the link to order menus, time and venue etc, on the link it said the 14th, again you confirm. On 29th of June we went back onto the link to pay the full amount,  again the link said 14th July, you confirmed again. On 1st of July you sent me an email with the date now saying 13th and our chefs name, I rang you straight away because all the other emails you sent confirmed our date of the 14th, consequently as a result of receipt of your numerous confirmations that meal would take place on the 14th July the arrangements for attendance, menu cards had already been finalised.

The chef was a lovely man, (Georgi) and the food was amazing.  He even added a couple of extra tasters.   All dietary requirements were accommodated and all cleared up afterwards.  It was an expensive treat but made our occasion really special"

Food was wonderful, presented very well and everything was so clean after he left. Defo 5 star rating.

Have never considered a private chef before but lockdown restrictions meant we could not eat out. After reading the reviews online I thought I’d “give them a go”. I have been impressed from start to finish with brilliant response times on emails and flexibility with me asking to change menu options. I chose the “indulge” 11-course meal and Andy, our allocated chef, did a stunning job. All courses were simply delicious. Beautifully prepared, cooked and presented. As many other reviewers have commented, the kitchen was left spotless at the end. Andy didn’t use the dishwasher, he hand washed everything so I didn’t have the hassle of emptying the dishwasher in the morning! Wonderful! He was a pleasure to have in our home, very engaging and talking through each course and the preparation as we journeyed through the menu. Would highly recommend and without doubt will consider using them again, even when lockdown restrictions are lifted. Thank you to all the events team, and in particular Andy, for making this such a fantastic evening for my husband’s birthday."

It was worth every penny. Our party was mixed between 2 adults and 2 children, and mixed dietary requirements. Was this a problem? NO.We had a lovely chef called Michael beugnet. He was prompt on arriving at the time discussed, talked through with us about the food, where it was sourced, what ingredients he used. He used our plates and kitchen which wasn’t a problem and served the food in a way where we didn’t notice the plates. We were informed the whole time about food, courses, timings, Michael cleaned as he went, super tidy and left our home like he found it. The food was beautifully presented, in a timely manner, and tasted divine. My 5 year old picked at his 9 courses (as he’s a tired picky 5 year old) and my wife loved it so much she possibly had 15 courses. We supplied our own wine and champagne and there was no additional trying to up sell by DineInDulge, although in future I’d probably give this a go. There was no problem for Michael as my wife FaceTimed her family during courses and sang his praises.We hired an outdoor stargazer dome and this experience of 9 courses. There’s not very much you can do in lockdown but I don’t think my wife’s 40th could have gone any better. Thanks Michael and the team at DineInDulge. You really did make a special day perfect!"

The chef was great with all of our guests and the children - who tentatively watched a lot of what he was doing with interest and awe!! The food was amazing!  We chose the Indulge - French menu.  It was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. I felt like we were in a 5* restaurant, the service was brilliant and the chef addressed the table at each course to talk to us about the food.The chef cleaned the kitchen really well - it was gleaming!! He helped himself to all our pots and pans as if he knew exactly where everything was (which really put me at ease) and then loaded up the dishwasher and cleaned leaving it spotless.Everyone loved the evening. It was a huge success and was a really great thing to do in such a strange time with the current Covid-19 situation. We will definitely do this again.  Thank you to our chef and to the team behind all of this - you have been brilliant, helpful in every response to my questions on email and it really made a very special birthday feel really special."

The chef, Bernard contacted us on the day and arrived in good time.  He took over our kitchen whilst we sat socially distanced outside.  We had put up and dressed a gazebo to give the feel of an al-fresco restaurant.Throughout the whole evening, Bernard was friendly and professional.  We were asked to ensure we had crockery for our guests but not excessive as the Chef would wash dishes between courses.  We were also asked to clear some space in our fridge and freezer for storage of the food which was all provided by dineindulge and brought by the chef.

The chef arrived and hadn’t been told it was a hen party so he walked straight into a lot of raucous behaviour. It never fazed him. He just got on with it. The food was amazing- cooked to perfection, one of the best steaks we had all had in a long time and we all eat at good restaurants regularly. He explained what each course was without interrupting our conversation or being pushy. He cleaned up everything quickly and quietly afterwards so that we could carry on with our evening. I would highly recommend using them and I will be booking them again for another evening"

They cleaned up within 15 minutes of serving coffee and were off. It was a truly stress free and wonderful experience.

Their assumption that all bookings are at 19:30 is crazy!  They shouldn’t allow customer to have confirmed booking if they haven’t given the customer time slots agreed for their events and just assumes it’s 19:30 - that’s crazy business assumption! Furthermore, how can you shop for a customer that you haven’t fully confirmed with then pass on the costs to that customer when your silly assumed time of events doesn’t suit the customer? Go figure that one out! Your processes there is seriously lacking and it has to come to a bad review on Trustpilot to get your management to think more clearly about their less than 14days prior to event booking process.They refunded some of the costs but kept some. Happy dining for the chef on my paid for produce and his time in getting his dinner for free on this day. I wonder how often that happens - FREE MEALS for chefs?!Avoid booking with this firm if your event is less than 14days from quotation and confirmation!!!!In response to your response on 30June2019:Don’t lie please!I didn’t book for 19:30 then moved it to 12:30 or 13:30. The fact which you have already admitted to is that your system automatically sets a time of 19:30 and didn’t make clear that one could change the time. You then confirmed it’s ok on proceeded to order the produce and book the chef as confirmed. You are learning a very worthy lesson for your business processes and in how you treat your customers. Focus on the learnings and taking progressive actions and less on your excuses please. If I didn’t have a valid review I am sure Trustpilot would have removed my review but it’s still here so make of it what you will. Just learn the lessons and take action to fine tune your booking and customer service processes."

Booking was very easy & great choices of menus to choose from. We received a  phone call the day before to confirm the arrival time. On the day our Chef arrived as scheduled and changed into his cheffing gear when he got to our lodge. All the food was freshly prepared and served on time. The food was lovely, tasted amazing and beautifully presented. Our chef cleaned up everything after himself and when he left it was cleaner than before he started and like he had never been... other than us all being very full and amazed at what we had just experienced! Our kitchen work space where we was staying was tiny so to be able to prepare and cook a 3 course meal in it to that high standard is amazing!!!! Thank you very much!

His asssitant was attentive and incredibly polite. He explained every course and each was presented beautifully. He left the kitchen complete imaculate ( I would even say cleaner than when he arrived!) I would recommend this company again and I would specifically request for Bernard too. My only suggestion would be to start the 9 course menu a little earlier than 7pm having said that the entire evening was very relaxed and one that we will talk about for a long time to come.

The food was very good and the fact Dine Indulge take charge of the entire dinner from start to finish (including the vital clearing up and away at the end!) means that you can focus on entertaining your guests. If I had to fault one thing it would be that the portions could have been a little more generous, since I had been assured when booking that the sharing menu was substantial enough to work as a main meal when in actual fact, while people didn't exactly go hungry, there wasn't all that much to go round and there seemed to be a lot of certain things and then rather a lot less of others (and unfortunately the latter were often the more popular things!). Nevertheless, it is a very good quality service. In future I think it would be worth illustrating more clearly the quantities and portion sizes of the sharing menu option so that customer expectations are clear from the outset. The Dine Indulge Team were very helpful throughout the process so I'm sure this is achievable!"

Adam was brilliant, the food was delicious and the kitchen clean! We are a tough crowd when it comes to food, one of our party is a chef working in Michelin star restaurants and we all thought the experience was wonderful. Thank you for working so hard for finding a replacement at short notice, Adam was fantastic."

Good to have some 'curated' menus rather than the overwhelming choice of other private chef sites, fair price and good service leading up to the event. Our chef was excellent, prepared and served delicious food and left the kitchen pristine. I would certainly use again. My only point of feedback would be that we only confirmed timings with the chef on the day, which would have been helpful to have done a few days earlier."
