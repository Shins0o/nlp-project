5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2022-10-01,Catherina mc Gleenon,We use the Dinggly system within my‚Ä¶,"Dinggly‚Äôs wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2022-10-08,Mark,We are delighted with the service‚Ä¶,"Dinggly‚Äôs wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

5,Dinggly,['Telecommunications equipment supplier'],4.7,2022-12-21,James Sawyer,Beyond all expectations!,"Dinggly‚Äôs wireless paging and call button systems make it extraordinarily easy for people to request the assistance of others.

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

Wherever you are, something you can always be assured of is a warm welcome.","Went to Zizzi Telford as a family now in the current climate going out is a treat and out of all the restaurants that we could have chosen we decided to go here.So we walked in and stood by the door and waited as the sign says wait to be seated, eventually a woman says that she will e a few minutes and we continued to wait, a few minutes later we were seated with our menus.I had a discount code for one starter and ordered a couple of starters to share, drinks and the mains. I also showed the waitress the zillionaires member code as it says too (first time I used it) the waitress went off and then came back and said that I could not have the free starter, no explanation I just could not have it, she said do you want to speak to the manager I said yes.The manager comes over I explain I have a code she takes it and I said that the waitress said I cant have it, no explanation, so off she goes and then comes back and says that the code is not able to be used on a Friday and did I still want the starter I said yes and thanks for letting me know that it could not be used, and tells the waitress that I want the order still.The waitress comes over 5 minutes later and asks again do I still want the starter again yes I still want the starter.The starters arrived after 45minutes, now the restaurant was not busy, and once the starter was finished the mains took ages to arrive also.The food is ok and I like the flavours but the portion size has been reduced and I would not normally be hungry still after going out for a meal, and especially after eating fresh pasta which is filling, but on this occasion I was.The manager came over and I asked for the bill she walked off, I thought to go get the bill as she was by what looked like a till, then she disappeared and we could not see her, then we noticed her doing stuff behind the bar I think she was sorting glasses or stocking the fridge.So, we went to the front counter and eventually she came over and I paid, also it turns out that with the use of the zillionaires club I should have been entitled to a free garlic bread, but I have lost out on that now because should have been given to me on my visit.Overall not the best and I will think long and hard before returning, if I ever do.

We chose the Red Lion in Cricklade. The communication from GG was excellent. They confirmed the booking and told us we weren‚Äôt to worry about taking the voucher as it wasn‚Äôt necessary, the pub was expecting us. I then got another email wishing us a lovely evening on the Friday prior to the booking.  On arrival to the venue we were a little dubious as always when using a voucher, but true to the confirmation received from GG, the booking had been received and our table was waiting for us. The meal was excellent and we enjoyed the experience very much. I even texted my daughter To say we had found a lovely place and that they should try it. The embarrassment started when the bill came and the price was for the full amount ¬£83. I told her that we had booked through GG and that we had redeemed a ¬£50 voucher when making the reservation through GG.  She then said she would check with her boss, then came back to the table and asked for the voucher or some kind of proof. GG said I would not need the voucher!!! So embarrassing! She then went off with the voucher. 5 minutes later the Maitre came over to say that they didn‚Äôt accept vouchers and that we were fortunate as the voucher was valid until the end of the year so we could use it somewhere else! Mortified by now, we refused and showed him the 2 emails from GG. He then shot off and we saw him speaking on the phone. Perhaps to his superior. He then came over and started to backtrack and apologise because his superior hadn‚Äôt told him or any of the staff about GG. He then asked if we had enjoyed our meal and proceeded to charge us ¬£33. The whole final experience spoiled the night. We felt stupid and cheap, we decided last minute not to leave the ¬£10 tip which we thought the staff deserved for the simple reason that we were embarrassed. Lack of communication from management to staff ruined our lovely evening. So our advice to voucher redeemers is be cautious. We later wondered if we should have mentioned it on arrival but GG said there was no need to even show the voucher, that the venue would be aware. If we had mentioned it, we would have probably not been shown to our table as the Maitre had no idea whatsoever. Unbelievable!  Finally, these vouchers are issued to people with good intention but sometimes they are a pain in the butt.

The thing that really dissapointed me was the mocktails I asked for a Pina colda which had a very soar taste when i informed the waiter he kindly offered to replace it with a mango mocktail however this did not taste like a mocktail it tasted like a rubicon mango with added ice and some mint leaves. Which is not good as you paying nearly 5 pounds for a drink.Overall I do feel the place needs to upgrade the food to reflect their prices, also they refused to give us tap water and wanted us to buy bottled water or drinks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",visit place yesterday lack wait long seat howev food averag noth special kiss meal chip chicken suggest pound would expect mayb fruit shoot children drink price thing realli disappoint cocktail ask pink cold soar tast inform waiter kindli offer replac mang cocktail howev tast like cocktail tast like rubicon mang ad ice mint leav evil pay nearli pound feel place need upgrad food reflect price also refus give us tap water want us buy bottl water drink,visit place yesterday

3,Strada,['Restaurant'],2.8,2023-09-05,Sukanya,Unethical Payment Practices,"Strada is all about great quality, simple, freshly prepared pizza, pasta and risotto served in a stylish contemporary surrounding.","I had dinner at Strada in Southbank this evening. The food was decent and the service was pleasant. My problem is the unethical manner of payment. There was a QR code on the table which said you can scan it to pay. I scanned it and it showed the bill along with an 'optional 12.5% service charge'. It isn't really optional as you have to specifically ask a member of staff to have this removed. That aside, the service was positive so I was happy to pay the SC. I went to pay my part of the bill (¬£14.50) plus SC which came to ¬£16.32. However this is when it got dodgy. The website then asks you if you want to pay a 'tip' and it automatically had ¬£2 selected as the 'tip'. I had to select ¬£0 as the 'tip' in order to not pay the additional ¬£2. Had I not noticed then I would have ended up paying the ¬£2 as well as the legitimate SC.It is super shady to add a so called tip on top of SC and put the onus on the customer to deselect the ¬£2 button. I can imagine alot of customers get caught out by this because you may think that the SC has not been added and go ahead and pay the extra money. What is the justification for this? What is the justification for requiring the customer to actively unselect a button when they are already paying the 12.5% SC? At the very least you must not have the ¬£2 pre selected option. The customer needs to actively consent and understand what they are paying for, which means giving them the choice to add additional service charge if they feel it is warranted. By pre selecting an option, you are taking away the choice which is unfair and unethical. It is prejudicial to the customer and financially benefits the company. Given that ¬£2 is a relatively small amount hardly any customers would bother to complain to the restaurant if they paid it without actually wanting to. Presumably that's the intention behind the practice, which is why it continues to operate.",dinner strata southbank even food decent servic pleasant problem ethic manner payment code tabl said scan pay scan show bill along servic charg realli option specif ask member staff remov asid servic posit happi pay went pay part bill plu came howev got podgi webster ask want pay automat select select order default addit ignor would end pay well legitim super shadi add call tip top put one custom select button imagin clot custom get caught may think differ ad go ahead pay extra money justif justif requir custom activ select button alreadi pay least must lack pre select option custom need activ consent understand pay mean give choic add addit servic charg feel warrant pre select option take away choic unfair ethic prejudici custom financi benefit compani given rel small amount hardli custom would bother complain restaur paid without actual want presum intent behind practic continu oper,ethic payment practic

He was friendly and courteous and explained that I received the original message due to an internal error. He managed to resolve the situation quickly and turn a negative experience into a positive one. Original message below (1 star review): Gourmet Guide has responded to several reviews on this site saying that it is rare for them to enforce expiry date rules. This is disingenuous, as I contacted them today regarding vouchers that we didn't realise were expired and was told that the system cannot redeem expired vouchers.  We were given vouchers as a wedding gift last September, and had planned on using them to celebrate our anniversary. When we got the vouchers out to book, we realised they expired within nine months. After reading Gourmet Guide's responses on this website (for example, GG's response on 24/06/2019 - ""In reality it is very rare for us to enforce the expiry date rules and expired vouchers are honoured 99% of the time""), I contacted them (enquiries @gourmetguide.co.uk) to see if it would be possible to honour the voucher. The reply that I received was as follows: ""Hi,Thank you for your email.Our Vouchers do expire after 9 months, so unfortunately there is no way of redeeming these at this date.If they were still in date we could extend for an additional charge, but with them being fully expired our system wont allow us to redeem now.Sorry again.Kind Regards""So either the claim that vouchers are honoured 99% of the time is false, or these are the 1% of vouchers that are not honoured (with no explanation why ours will not be and the other 99% would be).Really displeased with this interaction and the misleading information that has been given in response to bad reviews. I understand if it's not possible to redeem the expired vouchers, but they should not indicate that they will be honoured if this is not the case.",edit post origin review tom gourmet guid got touch abl extend voucher friendli courteou explain receiv origin messag due intern error manag resolv situat quickli turn neg experi posit one origin messag star review gourmet guid respond sever review site say rare enforc expir date rule disingenu contract today regard voucher realis expir told system redeem expir voucher given voucher wed gift last septemb plan use celebr anniversari got voucher book realis expir within nine month read gourmet guid respons webster exampl go respons realiti rare us enforc expir date rule expir voucher honour time contract inquiri see would possibl honour voucher repli receiv follow hi thank voucher expir month unfortun way redeem still date could extend addit charg fulli expir system wont allow us redeem regard either claim voucher honour time fals voucher dishonor explan differ would displeas interact mislead inform given respons bad review understand imposs redeem expir voucher contraind honour case,mislead expir voucher

Featuring cloud technologies, our range includes premium quality call buttons and virtual call buttons (driven by QR codes). Calls can be received on mobile phones, tablets, smartTVs, Dinggly wrist pagers, compatible smart-plugs, a computer browser or integrate with other software. 

Our call button paging systems work over your WiFi network so range is never an issue as long as a button is connected to WiFi. Staff can be on any WiFi or cellular network to receive the calls.

Dinggly call button paging systems are found in hotels, restaurants, offices, retailers, educational institutions and factories around the world.

Customers can configure and update their pager systems via a secure portal. Tasks such as changing the name of a call button or staff login names are easily performed.

The calling device, responder and response time are logged against every call. For those that want access to this data, Dinggalytics provides a rich pool to information to evaluate your system and operation.


The main benefits of a Dinggly paging system are: * Dinggly Call buttons are intelligent devices with 2-way communication. When someone presses the button, they see a blue light and hear a sound (optional). When the call is accepted on any device, the light changes to green, and a sound is heard, so the caller knows someone is on their way. * Dinggly receiving devices talk to one another - so when a receiving device accepts a call, it tells all the other devices which received the same call that the call is in hand, and who accepted the call. This avoids duplicated effort. * The calls can come through to alert any combination of mobile phones/tablets/desktops/laptops/Smart TV's and/or Dinggly supplied WiFi Wrist Pager watches. * Up to 3 levels of call escalation are available for calls which are not answered within a preset time delay. * Calls from Call buttons can be directed to different recipients based on call source and call type. * Due to the cloud architecture of the Dinggly system, there are no distance limitations to implementing the solution, as long as there is a WiFi signal where the Call Buttons and Dinggly WiFi Watches are used, and a WiFi or cellular signal where mobile receiving devices are used. * When the call button needs to be recharged, it sends out an email to one or more persons. * Dinggly offers a very high level of reliability as there are no on site servers which can fail, since all devices communicate with a central cloud based data centre.

She said the only way to get my order was for me to do a BACS transfer for the amount and they would refund my card.

1,Franco Manca,['Restaurant'],2.7,2023-10-24,Chris Welsh,Very sad to see another poor customer service experience. Why,Franco Manca - Sourdough Pizza. The pizza is made from slow-rising sourdough (minimum 20 hours) and is baked in a wood burning oven.,"We discovered Franco Manca in august, Southampton branch. It was the only restaurant with a table in the area and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. We thought the sourdough pizza was a bit chewing good texture and red wine in a tumbler? The menu is only pizza and some odd topping choices but hey Ho we were hungry. So when we recently were in london, the Aldwych branch popped up as a pre theatre option and we figured okay let‚Äôs go! We booked a table for 5:30 and arrived bang on time. On arrival the guy who checked us in frankly couldn‚Äôt really be bothered. They were clearly busy, but there is no need to make your ‚Äòguests‚Äô feel like they don‚Äôt want you to be there. There was no table, He said can you sit over there at the bar. In any other restaurant I have ever been to this means we will hold you here until a table is free but no, the bar here is four seats next to each other to eat. Not an ideal family meal out. Families came in after us and we‚Äôre show to a table of four. So what is the point of booking a table? We were given no choice but we English don‚Äôt want to kick up a fuss and nor do I want to do so on a family night out with our young Son. The food was poor all the toppings were literally thrown into the middle of the pizza so most of the pizza is just dough and a bit of cheese at best. Wine in a tumbler. Rustic some might say. Okay but just no better than a cheap takeaway in the street. When we came to pay they had added a service charge said optional and make no mistake I always reward good service but the guy who we met and who did most of the servicing was poor communication and just did not gel with his customers so I asked for the service charge to be removed. They then all went into a huddle and giving us the eye making us feel uncomfortable. He asked why and I told him why and he said we are having a very busy night. Sorry but that‚Äôs no excuse for not caring and making customers feel like they have had a service. If your not in a rush and just want a cafe pizza indoors but no engagement from the staff and happy without a restaurant experience but pay restaurant prices then okay but we won‚Äôt be going again. Looking at overall reviews another soon to be victim of nice try but failed. You‚Äôd think a company of this size would listen to its customers and get the staff and n basic customer service courses.

This seems very unfair especially as I had previously paid card tips in good faith, expecting them to go to the waiting staff.

The service is designed to be relaxed and personable with your chef introducing each dish to the table, as well as clearing and cleaning down the kitchen and even doing the washing up before they leave!","Absolutely shocking experience, chefs are great but the company is managed appallingly. Avoid at all costs if you want certainty that a chef will show up.I booked a chef through this company for a hen do in April months in advance. 7 days before my event I received an email saying that the chef assigned to my event was no longer available and was told that there were no other chefs available that evening. This was incredibly frustrating and stressful so close to the time, and with it being the key part of an event (as most of their bookings are) I had no flexibility. Finding another company in such short notice for a Saturday evening booking was not an option. I asked about other options and was told that they could keep looking for chefs, but couldn‚Äôt say the likelihood of being able to find one - not helpful when planning an event. Eventually I cancelled some other activities and reorganised the entire weekend to get a booking on the Friday night, and was given a 10% discount - not good enough in my opinion.At the time I thought this was a one off so didn‚Äôt write a review. However, my boyfriend (who is currently planning an event) has just had exactly the same thing happen to him, and was sent an email with exactly the same vaguely worded email which does not seem to be a coincidence! He is now left 9 days before an event (again a Saturday evening) which he cannot rearrange, and has been told that they will keep looking for a chef and that there is a ‚Äú50/50 chance of finding one‚Äù.Looking at other reviews this seems to be a recurring problem with others having the same issue. It‚Äôs simply not good enough and for a company that specialises in providing an indulgent experience for special events, cancelling a booking with such short notice should never be considered acceptable.I appreciate that some last minute situations can‚Äôt be helped, but the company clearly has no feasible back up solution in place. To happen once could be excused but to happen twice (2 out of 2 bookings) is outrageous.This is no reflection on the chefs - who have been great, but the company has shocking management, they‚Äôre clearly overbooking events and should have enough back up chefs to ensure that this situation never happens. They can only help you if you rearrange your entire weekend or event to work around their schedule.",absolut shock experi chess great compani manag appal avoid cost want certainti chef show book chef compani hen april month advanc day event receiv email say chef assign event longer avail told chess avail even incred frustrat distress close time key part event book flexibl find anoth compani short notic saturday even book option ask option told could keep look chess say likelihood abl find one help plan event eventu cancel activ reorgan entir weekend get book friday night given discount evil enough time thought one write review howev boyfriend current plan event exactli thing happen sent email exactli vagu word email seem coincid left day event saturday even rearrang told keep look chef chanc find one review seem recur problem other issu simpli evil enough compani specialis provid indulg experi special event conceal book short notic never consid appreci last minut situat help compani clearli feasibl back solut place happen could excus happen twice book reflect chess great compani shock manag clearli overlook event enough back chess ensur situat never happen help rearrang entir weekend event work around schedul,use cancel week event

Today, Saturday, October 28, at five o‚Äôclock in the evening, I invited my family to have dinner at Nando‚Äôs Cheltenham on the occasion of my daughter‚Äôs 16th birthday in Cheltenham city center.  There was a tall blonde girl on the entrance, perhaps 18 years old,  I asked her for a table for three people. She pointed to the location of the table, and it was inappropriate, small, and located in the corridor. So I asked her to move to another table after it was finished, and it was occupied by 3 people. She made an excuse and said that it was only for two people, and she lifted the third chair.  Then I saw two white people moved from their table to another table without taking her permission, and she did not speak to them or stop them.  Another table was empty for 6 people, so she called white woman with her child who was waiting at the entrance and gave her the table. After that, another table was empty for four people, so I asked a black waitress to move, and she agreed. After we moved, the first blonde waitress came and refused to let us sit there and asked to return to our first table, so I asked her about  The reason and why she said it was for four people and you are three, knowing that at that time no one was waiting at the entrance and she spoke to us with arrogance and contempt and did not prohibit us because we were old.  Then she called another person who worked with her and claimed to be the manager. He was very agitated and treated us with arrogance and contempt and asked us to return to our first table or leave the restaurant.  Then the security man brought us and ordered us to leave by force.

We watched as they walked past the dirty tables over and over again without even picking up a plate to take to the kitchen! It wouldn't have taken ten minutes to clear them and reset them - it's not even like the place was busy! It took at least 15 minutes for a waitress to come back and take our order and then we waited another 15 minutes for our food - with three customers in the place????By the time the food came out we still hadn't received our soft drinks either which is really not good enough.On seeing my friend's food I knew immediately that it was over cooked and she took one mouthful and knew the fish was off.

Tonight we had Chicken milanaese which has changed to cheaper processed chicken, smaller cheaper fried potatoes and they have decided to take all sauce away so very dry. The Salmon risotto was an extremely small portion that should not be allowed to be called Salmon. If the was 0.1% Salmon in this under cooked, pre packaged dish I would be very surprised. The vegetable lasagne was the worst of them all. Once again very small portions that is they are selling as 6 layer vegetable lasagne with a list of delicious vegetables. In reality there are 6 layers of pasta with a tomato sauce with potentially some vegetable mixed in with blender. A 1 course meal with a tip for 4 of us with water was ¬£80 for absolute trash processed, pre bagged food. First thing we did when we got home was to make some more food as still hungry, and we are not big eaters Would have been much nicer and much much cheaper and fulfilling to pop into supermarket and get some ready made meals.

1,Paya Cuisine,['Restaurant'],1.4,2014-05-24,Gulden,"Awful, bland, tasteless, unappetising Thai food","paya is ""still one of the best Chinese restaurants in London. With over 25 years of history, Paya has stood the test of time because of the quality of its food, service and surroundings"".","Really fancied Thai food as it's so fresh tasting and colourful and Paya Friend Barnet came up in the search engine as the only place that delivered to my post code. I ordered chicken satay and crispy crab claws with plum sauce for starters and chicken pad Thai for myself and Chicken Green curry for my sister. When they delivered the driver complained that there was no parking near my home and he had to park a mile away and walk a mile.
The food arrived in lovely containers and got chop sticks. The peanut sauce for the satay chicken was warm and of jelly consistency and the crispy crab claws came with a chilli sauce and both tasted awful and bland.
At this point I rang the restaurant to say the sauces are wrong and spoke to Mohsen who was in denial that the crispy crab claws come with a plum sauce, after checking he agreed. He informed me that their peanut sauce always came like that. I told him I was left dissatisfied with the starters and wanted a refund on these and that we had not yet tasted the mains. He told me that because I paid by card online that he was unable to refund my card but could offer a credit note. I told him I was not satisfied with the starters and would not be coming buying from food again therefore a credit note was pointless.
When I asked for a refund on my card he said if his driver had taken the payment at the door on his credit card machine then a refund could be given but because it was done over the web page this wasn't permitted, however he would speak to his manager. He kept me waiting for a few minutes and came back on the line and told me his manager said no refund only credit. I asked to be put through to the manager and he said I called him and this is what he said.
Then he got angry and told me that I hadn't even tried the main and what was I complaining about, I hung up the phone as I felt I was getting angry.
My sister and i tried the mains - Chicken Thai green curry that tasted like chicken swimming in dish water and my Chicken Pad Thai that tasted like crushed peanuts smeared over over cooked noodles with overcooked chicken - disgusting.
My sister and I gathered all the food and threw it in the bin and called Top Wok to place a chinese meal as Paya and their Thai food definitely did not live up to to our expectations nor look as advertised on their web page.
I called the restaurant back and asked to speak to Mohsen, when he came on the line I told him the mains were disgusting too, and that originally I was not asking for a full refund, but now will be writing to his manager demanding a full refund to which he replied that he was surprised as I was the first person to complain about the food. I told him the chef hasn't a clue how to make Thai food.

2,Nandos,['Restaurant'],2.4,2023-11-03,Sean,Shockingly Poor Customer Service,,"We went out for a family meal last night to Nandos (Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth).  Arriving around 7pm we had to wait 5 minutes to be seated.  After spending 10 minutes or so deciding what to eat my Dad and Sister went to the counter to order.Dad and his partner did not want a starter and my Sister had olives, but I then had to wait over half an hour for just some sweet potatoes.  Not the best start.  Fortunately the main course arrived just as I was finishing my starter, but that was still another 15 minutes.After finishing the main course we decided we would have a dessert so Dad went back to the counter, ordered (4 Pastel de Natas & 2 Choc-A-Lot cakes), and paid.  There was nothing that should have taken long to prepare especially considering the Pastel de Natas were in a display case at the service counter.We then waited a further 1/2 hour and the desserts still had not arrived so Dad went back to the counter to chase the order, then came back and sat at the table.  5 minutes or so later one of the staff came over and advised that they only had 1 Pastel de Nata left and advised that if we still wanted them we would have to wait for more to be cooked, or we could pick something else or have a refund.  After a brief discussion we decided on a refund for those items.We then waited yet another 15 minutes (possibly more) and the Choc-A-Lot cakes had still not arrived (though they had brought Dad's refund over) so Dad went back to the counter to chase again and advised that if the cakes weren't going to be ready in the next 5 minutes he wanted a refund.  He came and sat back down.The cakes finally arrived about 5 minute later (running total of at least 50 minutes waiting time just for dessert).  It was now about 9:50pm.A few minutes later another staff member came over (presumably a manager), knelt beside Dad, and started (politely) berating him for shouting at one of the girls at the service counter who he had apparently made cry.  Dad just nodded.Now in all of my life I don't think I have ever heard my Dad shout.  He is over 80 now, hard of hearing, and won't wear his hearing aid as he finds it too uncomfortable; as a result of this speaks quite loudly sometimes, but he has never, in my experience, shouted at anybody.  I, on the other hand, am quite capable of raising my voice should the need arise so I stayed out of the conversation.We asked Dad what the manager had said and he shrugged and confirmed he had only heard a few words.While I understand the desire to protect your staff, not only did the manager not get both sides of the story here and therefore made a completely one-sided snap judgement, but he virtually completely failed to acknowledge the utterly abysmal service we had received that evening.It should not take 3 hours to serve 3 small courses especially as the restaurant, while full at the start of the evening, was half empty by the time we had ordered our desserts.When you have clearly run out of a dessert item, is it not common sense to go to the kitchen and request more or, if there is no more, tell the customer and ask them to choose something else?Had Dad not gone to chase the food twice we would have been waiting the until closing as they had clearly completely forgotten about us.Unsurprisingly, none of us will ever be visiting Nandos again!",went famili meal last night hand gunwharf quay portsmouth arriv around pm wait minut seat spend minut decid eat dad sister went counter partner want start sister live wait half hour sweet potato best start fortun main cours arriv finish start still anoth finish main cours decid would dessert dad went back counter order past de mata cake paid noth taken long prepar especi consid past de mata display case servic wait hour desert still leav dad went back counter chase order came back sat tabl minut later one staff came advis past de data left advis still want would wait cook could pick someth els refund brief discuss decid refund wait yet anoth minut possibl cake still leav though brought dad refund dad went back counter chase advis cake go readi next minut want refund came sat back cake final arriv minut later run total least minut wait time dessert minut later anoth staff member came presum manag knelt besid dad start polit beat shout one girl servic counter appar made cri dad life think ever heard dad shout hard hear wo wear hear aid find uncomfort result speak quit loudli sometim never experi shout anybodi hand quit capabl rais voic need aris stay ask dad manag said shrug confirm heard understand desir protect staff manag leav side stori therefor made complet snap judgement virtual complet fail acknowledg utterli abysm servic receiv give hour serv small cours especi restaur full start even half empti time order clearli run dessert item individu sens go kitchen request tell custom ask choos someth els dad stay_in_plac chase food twice would wait close clearli complet forgotten none us ever visit hand,shock poor custom servic

A rewards program isn't worthwhile if it doesn't cover all your stores - no doubt they've spent a fortune on designing a loyalty programme & related app/marketing to be considerably worse than stamped cardboard. I gave up and uninstalled their app, tried to unsubscribe from the emails. After unsubscribing they continued to email me & said go to ""update your preferences"" instead.

2,Subway,['Restaurant'],1.9,2023-08-10,daniel,Disappointed by Rising Prices and Unexpected Charges,SUBWAY - Eat Fresh,"I have been a loyal customer of Subway for over a decade, consistently purchasing 2 to 3 subs a week on my lunch break at work. However, I must say that my recent experience has left me disheartened and questioning my loyalty to the brand. Over the years, I understand that prices naturally rise due to inflation, but the sharp increase I witnessed today was quite unexpected.During my visit to Subway in Willenhall, I was informed that an extra ¬£2 would be added to my order simply for the inclusion of cheese. This news came as a surprise because cheese has always been a complimentary addition to my sub. Even more astonishing was the revelation that a single slice of regular cheese would now cost an additional ¬£0.50. This sudden change in policy and the dramatic increase in prices have left me feeling dissatisfied.Taking into account the amount of money I've been spending at Subway every week (ranging from ¬£20 to ¬£30), these new charges have made me seriously reconsider the value I now receive for my money. While I understand that businesses must adjust their prices, the recent price hikes seem to have spiraled out of control. As a result, unfortunately, today marks the end of my consistent patronage at Subway.Throughout the years, I have enjoyed the convenience and quality that Subway has provided, but the recent changes in pricing have made me question the affordability of their subs. While I appreciate the need for businesses to adapt to economic conditions, the drastic increase in prices for simple additions such as cheese has left me disappointed.I would have appreciated more transparency regarding these price adjustments, as I was caught off guard by the unexpected charges. Rather than feeling satisfied with my meal, I now question the overall value that Subway provides.Despite my disappointment, I must acknowledge that Subway has consistently provided fresh ingredients and a wide range of customisable options for their sandwiches. The quality of their bread and the variety of toppings available allow for a personalised dining experience. Additionally, the staff has generally been friendly and efficient, ensuring that orders are promptly prepared.However, with the recent price hikes, the overall value proposition offered by Subway has been significantly weakened. While I have enjoyed my meals at Subway for many years, it is regrettable that increasing prices have ultimately led me to seek alternative options for my lunchtime cravings.In conclusion, my longstanding loyalty to Subway has been tested due to the excessive price increases and unexpected charges introduced. Despite the positive aspects of their fresh ingredients and customization options, I can no longer justify the cost of their subs in relation to the value received. It is with a heavy heart that I bid farewell to Subway and seek alternatives that better align with my budget and expectations.",loyal custom subway decad consist purchas sob week lunch break work howev must say recent experi left dishearten question loyalti brand year understand price natur rise due inflat sharp increas wit today quit visit subway willenhal inform extra would ad order simpli inclus chees news came surpris chees alway complimentari addit sub even astonish revel singl slice regular chees would cost addit sudden chang polici dramat increas price left feel account amount money spend subway everi week rang new charg made serious reconsid valu receiv money understand busi must adjust price recent price like seem spirit control result unfortun today mark end consist patronag year enjoy conveni qualiti subway provid recent chang prick made question afford sob appreci need busi adapt econom condit drastic increas price simpl addit chees left would appreci transpar regard price adjust caught guard unexpect charg rather feel satisfi meal question overal valu subway disappoint must acknowledg subway consist provid fresh ingredi wide rang customis option sandwich qualiti bread varieti stop avail allow personalis dine experi addit staff gener friendli effici ensur order promptli recent price like overal valu proposit offer subway significantli weaken enjoy meal subway mani year regrett increas price ultim led seek altern option lunchtim conclus longstand loyalti subway test due excess price increas unexpect charg introduc despit posit aspect fresh ingredi custom option longer justifi cost sob relat valu receiv heavi heart bid farewel subway seek altern better align budget expect,disappoint rise price unexpect charg

We waited for quite some time when he came over again, asking to take the food order not at all happy when we said we were still waiting for our drinks which had been sitting on the bar for quite sometime. There seemed to be an ongoing issue between the two male staff members. After placing out order the starters came fairly quickly but were not up to usual standard.  Before the starter plates were cleared away the main courses arrived and plates had to be shuffled around. The atmosphere continued between the two waiters and no offer to clear the table of main course plates. We began to feel the restaurant getting colder it was now about 9.30pm no one came back to us for pudding order or coffee. The next time we saw somebody they were wanting us to pay the bill.

I really wish I had gone somewhere else now.Food was good however, the customer service was appalling. After waiting a long time to be seated, we made our order. For some reason, they served our main course before the starters? When it was pointed out that we wished for starters first, staff seemed startled by this request. How can they get this so wrong? Their own menu even mentions starters as ""pre pizza""? No apology from staff for this.Among others, the starters included Beef Ragu with bread (included). Unfortunately  the bread was not served and we had to ask for it. Things feeling awkward now and once again, no apology from the staff who seemed a bit stumped by us simply asking for what we had ordered.Pizzas came out after a long time waiting. Waiting to pay the bill took far too long as well.Overall, the food was good but the service was appalling. The waiting staff seem disinterested in their jobs and going by the glum look on their faces, probably don't want to work there. It was difficult attracting their attention for the things described above. No one even asked us if everything was OK with our meal.Took my girlfriend there hoping for a nice time and walked out feeling worse.

For us it was far to soggy underneath (I like sourdough but this was stodgy) and the large crust was heavy to consume. The toppings weren't well or evenly constructed and not much flavour either. Sadly a disappointment all round and likely won't be re visiting. After reading the reviews post our experience, I see some people have quoted 'best pizza' in their review???

We are both 6ft tall and leg space is always appreciated, but of course we would move if larger parties were to come in afterwards. Noone expects a 5* service (just a delicious pizza served with a smile, thank you!), but interactions with the staff were rather unpleasant - it felt like the place was run by teenage girls with no supervision or customer service training. The order arrived quickly, but no-one checked on us throughout dinner and eye contact attempts were proficiently ignored. We ran out of water and could not order anything else as the waitress simply brushed by the table collecting empty glasses/bottle without asking if refill is needed. The bill arrived incorrect and instead of explaining the error proactively, the girl waited for it to be questioned - again, no customer service skills whatsoever (where a simple sincere apology would have done the trick). We paid and left without placing any complaints as this would have been simply pointless and would make the experience even more bitter.All in all - although hospitality is going through a rough time - please train your staff better, service is still about quality not quantity.

I further sent an email to the Bournemouth branch to make sure our requirements could be met before arrival (a copy of which I still have).  When we were seated, the waiter brought along the menu.  I mentioned that I had sent in our special requests by email.  He seemed perplexed so the Manager was called over as the waiter could not understand our request for no butter on the bread, no mayo or cream for one and one person is vegetarian.  In discussion with the Manager, he said ""So why are you coming for Afternoon Tea when you can't have butter!""  This made us feel very uncomfortable.  My mother is 91 and cannot tolerate unprocessed butter, fats or cheese of any kind (her mother was the same) but is fine with butter when cooked in cakes, etc.  I said I had sent the branch an email to make sure our food intolerances could be catered for.  He said, ""I don't have time to read emails!"".  In this day and age of so many food allergies and intolerances, isn't it extremely important not to overlook customers' requests?!  The Manager implied that our food allergies and intolerances could be sorted on arrival but, in my experience, every venue we have been to before for Afternoon Tea has requested knowledge of this beforehand.  Despite this, the tea was very nice apart from the hard scone which must have been warmed up in the microwave.  For myself, vegetarian meant brie, brie or brie mini rolls.

After a trip to them today however, I can say for definite that I won't be going again. The lack of professionalism, poor quality food and lack of apology really did ruin a family birthday outing. I had noticed the last time I went that although the food seemed to continually go up in price that it wasn't really improving in quality, and we all left this time feeling very underwhelmed with the food itself. However, the main issue was something that had happened between the manager and a member of behind the bar staff who proceeded to take his anger out on the dishes and slammed them around all while we were trying to eat and chat relaxed (doesn't help that there is no door for the kitchen). The restaurant was not busy at all, yet it felt like they were all as stressed as though it was. It got to the point where my mum had to say something and the response we had from the waitress was 'well you see if it was busy you wouldn't really hear it' as though nothing had happened and didnt even apologise to us explicitly; despite the fact the staff member was much louder than anyone else and practically smirked at us while he did it. The manager seemed like he wanted nothing to do with it and made no attempt to come over and talk to us or even tell us he was going to sort out things with the angry member of staff. I'd never felt so poorly handled as a customer who's worked in customer service since being 15 - considering the ¬£104 bill with 25% discount - and that my family had come for a nice relaxing meal and we had to go have a coffee in Costa we felt so uncomfortable.

We only succeed after ordering for the third time, having in mind there were only 7 tables taken and loads of staff chatting by the bar.

2,Hawksmoor at Home ,['Meal Delivery'],4.1,2022-08-06,Pada Kay,Appalling service.,,"This was meant to be a pleasant experience. My daughter had just submitted her course work after having slogged away at it for weeks. We decided to celebrate on that Friday and so she booked a table at a restaurant. She then texted me back to say that she had changed the booking and booked it at Hawksmoor instead as she preferred to go there. We had been there quite a few times before and had liked it a lot. We arrived for 8 and were shown to our table. It was very busy, and the tables were packed closely together, so much so I could not get into my seat. I also accidentally knocked off the jacket of the lady seated behind me. I therefore asked to be seated at the next table and was kindly allowed to change the table. We ordered our drinks and starters and by the time we got them it was well past 8:30. When we finished the plates were removed and we waited for the main course. It was more than 35 minutes before we even got a chance to speak to a waiter. In the mean while the couple to my right who were in the middle of their starters when we arrived had finished their main course and had paid their bill and left. They were soon followed by another couple who were well into their starters and we still had not got our main course. The man and his son to my left who were seated after we had arrived had also finished their starter and their main course and paid and left. This was very frustrating to watch. We enquired as to what was happening about the time it was taking as both tables on either side had left. We were told that we were third in the queue. This really annoyed me. How could we be third when other people on tables nearby who had come after us had finished and left. When I questioned that, I was told something about temperatures. All the tables around me had ordered a steak like us and I asked how long it takes to make a steak and a burger and why was it longer than the tables on either side of us. They then came back and asked whether we wanted to eat or pay the bill and cancel the meal. This at a quarter to ten when we would not be able to go anywhere else to eat. We decided to eat any way and the meal was subsequently brought to us. The bun of the burger was burnt and to add insult to injury there was a plastic bit in the burger. By this time we had lost our appetite and any desire to eat. I was asked how the meal was!!. Waiter/manager said this was not a place to have this conversation and they would email us!! We asked the remainder of the steak to be packed for my dogs. Waiter came and brought the bag and offered us a box of chocolates which was a nice enough gesture but was not satisfactory at all. Our whole evening was ruined and what was meant to be an enjoyable meal was a disaster. The service was appalling, and I was deeply disappointed. In all fairness the steak was soft and cooked to perfection when I cut it up for the dogs later. The food has always been good in the Knightsbridge branch of Hawksmoor. Shame we could not enjoy the food due to the abysmal service.

I ate a normal amount, and had a strong msg reaction. Headache, rapid heart rate, sickness in stomach, stinging and itching on skin and feeling pretty bad all round.
 Spoke with the manager and refused a refund, he was adamant there was no msg in the food. I tried to explain that the food companies are deceptive nowadays and it was definitely in something in their food, even if it wasn't labelled. 
 Finally he offered to give me a discount next time, which wasn't much use. In the end he agreed to send out an order with no curry sauce or pastes from their bought in bottles and some egg fried rice. Which i think was reasonable. 
 If there was no msg or similar toxins in this food i would rate the restaurant 4 stars as the staff are respectful and the actual taste of the food is 4 stars or so. Price however is too high to justify.
 I won't order from here again because i value my health and after this strong msg reaction and the adamant and honest belief from the manager that no msg was in the food, clearly they don't know what is in it, and as they don't make their food from scratch and instead use cheap bought in pastes [coarse language] I won't be wasting my money here again.

We are also a key supplier in the United Kingdom of Two-way Radios from Motorola, ICOM, Kenwood, Entel and others. We manufacture our own earpieces and microphones that we guarantee are the best you can buy - ask for a free sample.

If you want quality paging and communications equipment that is designed to last with excellent customer support LRS UK will take care of you - that's why we have customers on our books going right the way back to 2001, and even further for non-paging equipment.

","Poor pager systems. Seem to stop working after six months. You have to unclip them from the holders to charge. So the holders end up breaking too. The buzzer system hasn‚Äôt got a page all setting which would be ideal at times.In summary, there are a lot better pager systems out there at will last a lot longer and will withstand constant use.",poor paper system seem stop work six month uncl holder charg holder end break buzz system got page set would ideal summari lot better paper system last lot longer withstand constant use,poor paper system

We were seated in such a cramped, tight space.  The restaurant was not busy and we decided we wanted to move seats.  We were shouted at by the woman who directed us to our seats.  Everyone turned around, which was embarrassing for us. I then told her that we were uncomfortable where we were originally seated.  We then moved to another corner where waitresses where going back and forth serving customers .  If it weren't for the fact we were tired and hungry, we honestly would have walked out at this stage. When the bill came the waitress added service charge to our bill without asking us, she did remove this after we queried it. I have been here in the past and have been greeted in a courteous manner.

Seated by the till at a low brown coffee formica table I was shocked to learn that this was indeed our table - not set ready waiting for our arrival and not the window seat as discussed during a courtesycall from the restaurant the day before. I paid ¬£200 for 5 afternoon teas, with a drink each and 10% service charge - booked weeks in advance.I'd seen the online menu so with these prices I expected the service and the ambiance.After the staff handed over their shift to one another, the joys of being in the area of the till and as the pop music blared out the speakers, so the long awaited drinks at ¬£10 each came out - and at the same time as the food. We had no opportunity to toast our celebration and enjoy the drinks.Instead we had to juggle them whilst a continual barrage of crockery came our way onto a table not fit for purpose - 5 side plates, a cake stand, a plate of scones, 5 dessert pots, 5 tea pots and 5 cups and saucers... I think that was everything...oh 2 pots of jam and 2 pots of cream - and the cutlery, wrapped in a paper serviette, it doesn't come with a much cheaper feel than that. To top the disappointment I'd given  the staff some extra little cake decorations to personalise the afternoon tea with as it was a special surprise for one of our party - they didn't materialise.On the plus side our Tea - as it stewed while we had our drink - was free to refill and the food was good,",exquisit experi restaur realiti like expens cafe floor seat till low brown coffe form tabl shock learn inde tabl rise readi wait arriv window seat discuss courtesycal restaur day paid afternoon tear drink servic charg book week seen onlin menu price expect servic staff hand shift one anoth joy area till pop music blame speaker long await drink came time food opportun toast celebr enjoy jungl whilst continu carriag crockeri came way onto tabl disagre purpos side plate cake stand plate stone dessert pot tea pot cup saucer think everyth oh pot jam pot cream cutleri wrap paper serviett come much cheaper feel top disappoint given staff extra littl cake decor person afternoon tea special surpris one parti plu side tea strew drink free refil food good,disappoint experi
